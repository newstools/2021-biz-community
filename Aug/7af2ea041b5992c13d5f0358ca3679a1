Additionally, these new metrics may provide better insights and offer more accurate reporting than just "number of printed issues distributed."Personalisation that scalesDigital advertising provides the ability to target a specific audience better and scale up quickly where necessary, allowing full control over what content goes where without concerns about having enough inventory for print campaigns. This allows advertisers to reach different audiences with tailored messaging.Rapid testing of new messaging and ideasDigital allows advertisers to explore what content resonates with people more than other forms of media, which should ultimately lead them to a better understanding of how best to communicate about their products or services. This means they’ll be able to reduce the time spent on finding the perfect creative message for each campaign since digital is so easily measurable by conversion rates, click-through rates, etc.Digital also allows advertisers to quickly tweak out messages that seem less effective in driving conversions or engagement between audience groups – meaning it doesn't take long before you know which message or offer has proven most successful at generating results.User share content on social mediaMany people are looking to social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, for their news, which means that they are captive audiences ready to soak up information that is relevant to themselves. Added to this, digital content is extremely easy to share across these networks, without having to print out a physical copy of a brochure or catalog.This has become increasingly prevalent as more and more people look to the convenience of simply going online to get the specific information they require. The ability to share information is a bonus for users - they can instantly recommend products or services across a broad network of acquaintances, something which is not easily achievable with print broadsheets or catalogues.Cross-sell and upsellDigital marketing has the ability to cross-sell or upsell products to users who have bought specific items in the past. Marketers find that this is a great way of keeping these customers engaged with their company; it can also be made into an automated process which means that when customers come back, they are more likely to buy again, as well as recommend the product or service to others.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2108/622891.jpg" alt="Primedia Outdoor continues to evolve AVR technology, now including colour recognition" width="120" height="120">Primedia Outdoor continues to evolve AVR technology, now including colour recognitionFollowing the positive results and ROI of Primedia Outdoor's Prime(i) Road and Prime(i) Mall technology and product offering, this innovative AVR (Anonymous Vehicle Recognition) technology has evolved even further and now includes colour...Issued by Primedia Outdoor 6 Aug 2021One is not advocating that marketers should not be using print but there is a strong case for using digital to supplement and amplify print campaigns. There is no arguing the fact that digital advertising has the ability to achieve more personalised content, is highly measurable, and ultimately can provide precise metrics such as Return on Ad Spend (RoAS).When faced with the question of what budget should be allocated for specific campaigns, advertisers should use digital to complement their print to drive deeper insights that are not available through print alone. This will help marketers extend their advertising reach with relatively precise knowledge of the efficacy of their campaigns.
