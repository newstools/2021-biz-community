Nike has maintained its perennial popularity with SA’s youth, claiming an 8th consecutive Overall Coolest Brand award, while also bagging the Coolest Clothing Brand and Coolest Footwear Brand awards at the 17th Sunday Times GenNext Awards. Apple placed overall second, while luxury brand Louis Vuitton moved into overall third spot from its 9th place position in 2020.The Sunday Times GenNext survey remains the leading barometer of what South Africa’s youth find on-trend and aspirational and delivers insights that are valued by brand management, advertising, and marketing professionals. The 2021 survey polled more than 6,000 young people aged 8-13 years (Tweens), 14 to 18 years (Teens), 18 to 24 years (Young Adults), and 25 to 30 years (Young Professionals). Eben Gewers, head of sales at Arena Events – which owns Sunday Times GenNext – believes the survey continues to deliver value, particularly during the economic uncertainty brought about by the Covid-pandemic. “It’s been a challenging 18 months to say the least, so having knowledge of shifts in youth attitude to products and brands - at a time when many families are economically stretched - is vital for marketers in shaping their future strategies.”Refilwe Malukeke, MD of Yellowwood, which conducts the Sunday Times GenNext survey, says the behavioural portion of the 2021 research highlights three levers that brands can use to build trust with young people and ultimately drive consideration and preference: accessibility, authenticity and community. “In addition to availability, brands can make themselves accessible by showing up in spaces where young people are in a relevant way. They can achieve authenticity by being consistent in everything they do, and finally consider the kind of positive impact they can have on communities or tribes that matter to young people,” says Maluleke.New categoriesThis year also saw the introduction of new categories reflecting rapid innovation and consumer technology adoption: Coolest Online Store (winner: Takealot.com), Coolest Technology Brand (winner: Samsung), Coolest Digital Learning Platform (winner: YouTube), and Coolest Fitness Device (winner: Apple Watch). For the first time, young people over 18 years of age were polled on their preference for alcohol brands - amongst this cohort, Savannah Cider was the most popular alcoholic beverage.In addition to polling consumer brand preference, the survey also polls youth on the personal brands of celebrities, entertainers and sportspeople.
