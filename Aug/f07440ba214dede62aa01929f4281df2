Out-of-home (OOH) advertising is traditional (non-digital and non-programmatic) outdoor advertising, targeting consumers when they are in public places, commuting to work, or in specific commercial locations. DOOH advertising is OOH powered by technology that provides features including tracking, retargeting, personalisation of ads, and greater attribution and measurement of campaigns.“As consumer preferences and lifestyles continue to change, the focus for brands and advertisers should remain on catering to people’s unique needs,” added Pereira. “Alfi is already seeing an increase in consumers' interest in, and willingness to, interact with digital advertising outside of their homes when the content is interesting and well-targeted.” Advertisers are increasingly demanding improved performance and capabilities from the ad technology they utilise. Alfi provides data-rich reporting functionality that informs advertisers that someone viewed their ad, the number of views, and each viewer’s reaction to the ad, as well as analytics, accountability, transparency, proof of engagement and actual impressions.
