Through the provision of guidance and constructive feedback, internships enable growth in the industry.They provide an opportunity for new workers to experience work expectations and cultures. Internships mark the beginning of effective networking, and allow workers to achieve credentials which makes them stand out in job interviews. The issue is that internships are often unpaid, which is problematic for students and young creatives from disadvantaged backgrounds who need to pay for their expenses. As a result, students and young creatives are expected to overcome an impossible experience gap.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/606316-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The One Club's Right the Ratio 2021 Summit to advance industry gender equity" width="120" height="120">The One Club's Right the Ratio 2021 Summit to advance industry gender equityIn line with its commitment to advance gender equality and inclusiveness in advertising, The One Club for Creativity has announced its latest Right the Ratio Summit taking place 18-20 May 2021...21 Apr 2021How companies can get involvedKevin Swanepoel, CEO of The One Club, has stated that agencies, brands, and other industry organisations are in a unique position which allows them to help young people advance their careers. “We call on them to sign the pledge to only offer paid internships, and support our drive to provide more equitable opportunities for economically disadvantaged and diverse candidates,” he said.
