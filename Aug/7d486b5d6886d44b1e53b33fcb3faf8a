These are defined as any type of measurement that can be counted and has a measurable impact on your bottom line.Without performance metrics, agencies can't be accountable to their clients and are flying blind. Performance data points like conversions or leads help them know how they're performing against other publishing efforts from month to month so that all of your hard work isn't going unnoticed - without accountability, you could lose out on potential revenue.7 business questions to ask before creating a websiteIt's more important than ever to have a website.

The emphasis is put more heavily on getting customers to interact with their posts in a way that will have long term benefits rather than short-term gratification from constantly checking analytics reports. While other tactics may get you some quick wins along the line (like amassing an impressive follower count), what really matters at this point are Return on Investment (ROI) measurements; ‘loyalty conversion rate’ that shows how often followers buy something from you post-following.Return on adspend (ROAS) is a measure of how successful your marketing and advertising investment has been and one of the most popular metrics for our clients.

Businesses of any size experience these pitfalls constantly because few can understand the process well enough and fewer still sketch out a clear path.An agency can measure performance by looking at the data on websites, social media accounts, email lists, or any digital property that is up and running.
