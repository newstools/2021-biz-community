It has also been an opportunity for some of South Africa's most loved local brands to align themselves in a visually creative way with this ground-breaking TV series.The project has been four years in the making, starting production February 2021, Known Associates Entertainment are the team behind this local take on the international hit Ugly Betty and have been working tirelessly to make sure there is a distinctly South African edge, with the local version aptly named uBettina Wethu. Producer Tshepiso Chikapa Phiri says: "It's a wonderful, universal story that has been told in more territories worldwide than any other franchise and we are so happy to be bringing it to life in South Africa."Shows like this create unique opportunities for brands that want to experiment with content, marketing and creativity. It also requires an element of insight and understanding, trust in the production team and a healthy dose of bravery! Stepping outside traditional advertising spaces exposes brands to audiences in new ways and gives them the ability to capture their customers attention, using compelling storylines that showcase their brand values. The benefit is that the messaging delivered within the content is specifically created and showcased in a way that isn't overly promotional.  uBettina Wethu is universally known and incorporates major story arcs and plot lines that are easily understood. Producers Know Associates Entertainment took the decision to follow a storyline integration and product placement approach similar to the popular American period drama Mad Men, as the series features dozens of real-life brands with products skillfully placed and unobtrusively integrated in the 'world of story'. Specialist media agency, Mediaheads360 joined as partner to KAE and was tasked with finding the right brand fit for the series. They successfully brought on board a portfolio of popular and most-loved South African skincare, bath care and hair care brands.Using a combination of passive, active and storyline integration, brands like Clere, Satiskin, Turbovite, LipIce, Young Solutions, Playboy, Playgirl and Gold Series will engage with their customers by associating with characters within the world of uBettina Wethu that share similar brand values and bridge the gap between awareness and ongoing affinity. "We've most definitely seen a rise in demand among astute brands and marketers for integrated content marketing opportunities aligned with locally produced flagship shows such as the uBettina Wethu series. After all, there's a whole window of opportunity and creativity awaiting. Why look through the window at the view when one can open the window and live the view, just the same as we live brands every day?" - Justin Keats, sales director, MediaHeads 360.Finding a new, fresh face to play the part of uBettina was key to the series and was an important show of support to the local film industry.
