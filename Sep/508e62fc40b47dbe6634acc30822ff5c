More recently, Hlela spearheaded Meltwater's first ever DE&I South Africa virtual summit on 22 June 2021. As DDEI, he will collaborate with leadership and management to identify, develop, and implement comprehensive strategies for recruiting, developing, retaining, and promoting underrepresented employees in South Africa.    “I embrace the role which drives our company's efforts to support all diverse groups across the region and addresses opportunities to improve diversity, equity and inclusion issues at Meltwater”, says Hlela.
