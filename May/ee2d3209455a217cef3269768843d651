According to the retailer, the world needs to embrace the optimistic, collaborative, free-thinking spirit of kids who are more informed and engaged than ever before."There are countless examples of youth taking action to make our world a better place, filling a vacuum left by those who we’d normally look to: adults. At a time of social and environmental upheaval, leadership has never been more paramount. This fundamental need inspired the company to explore how it could play a part in supporting the role models who are right in front of us and are shaping our future," H&M said in a statement.To launch the global campaign, H&M worked with double Oscar-nominated director Bryan Buckley to craft a short film featuring the kinds of role models the world needs. The goal of the film is to illustrate how young people view adults today, how initiatives large and small can improve the world, and to encourage people to reconsider the role models we have previously looked up to.Nominate a young role modelThe retailer is encouraging people to share their own role model story as inspiration to others and nominate kids who are remarkable role models. Later this year, H&M will spotlight these young changemakers' efforts and create awareness for how the broader community can support their work.H&M will also help support their causes using the proceeds from a new line of more sustainable clothing inspired by young role models, which is being developed by the H&M Kids design team.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/606165.jpg" alt="Soda Bloc launches &amp;quot;Be You.
