Alex FM in Alexandra, MAMS Radio in Mamelodi, West Side FM in Kagiso and Intokozo FM, in Durban all suffered catastrophic losses. But once again South African business has come to the rescue. Park Advertising, which encompasses media agencies The MediaShop and Meta Media, Tirisano Consulting and most recently Lucid Media, has as a Group assisted three of these stations, namely Intokozo FM, MAMS FM, and Westside FM to purchase essential studio equipment and transmitters to enable these stations to get back on air. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/619170-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Source:" width="120" height="120">National Association of Broadcasters condemns damage to community stationsThe National Association of Broadcasters has expressed concern for the damage caused to community radio stations in South Africa...15 Jul 2021Chris Botha, group MD of Park Advertising, says that community radio stations are one of the most essential media cogs in South Africa. “Communities have been torn apart, and community radio has the opportunity and ability to bring people together and develop positive narratives. Without community radio, we start to lose the fabric of community. While we’re pleased to be in a position to assist, we would like to challenge every business and individual in South Africa to support affected communities as a priority because we need to rebuild our faith in each other as much as we need to rebuild our country.”Dashni Vilakazi, MD at The MediaShop Johannesburg and Kagiso Musi, MD at Meta Media agree. “South Africans have proved time and time again just how incredible we are in coming together when tragedy strikes,” says Kagsio. “But we’d like to see more businesses and private citizens get involved. The smallest gestures can make the biggest difference in someone’s life. Be kinder, donate your time where you can or even just clearing out unwanted clothing can change someone’s life for the better.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/613680.jpg" alt="#Newsmaker: Dashni Vilakazi, newly appointed MD of The MediaShop Johannesburg" width="120" height="120">#Newsmaker: Dashni Vilakazi, newly appointed MD of The MediaShop JohannesburgDashni Vilakazi has been appointed as the new managing director for The MediaShop Johannesburg, effective 1 July 2021.
