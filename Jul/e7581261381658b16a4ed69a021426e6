From 14-20 July, the station will be collecting donations, revealing the total amount raised to the hospital and South Africa on Wednesday morning, 21 July during Good Morning Angels on Breakfast with Martin Bester. Gauteng’s health care system is severley drained as our daily heroes battle the third wave. To make matters worse, Johannesburg’s Charlotte Maxeke hospital was hard-hit by a devastating fire in April, putting additional pressure on surrounding hospitals – The Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital is one of them. “In 2019, we aimed to raise R400,000 to help 10 children receive a R40,000 heart operation at the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital Heart Centre. Good Morning Angels raised R1,8m, and the Round Table added an extra R900,000, totalling R2,7m raised. As if by fate, we helped 67 children received the critical intervention they needed, and they need us again,” comments Deirdre King, managing director at Jacaranda FM. In true Madiba spirit, no child is turned away from the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital because of a lack of funds. The hospital relies on donors and a small state subsidy to take care of the children. On average, R30,000 takes care of the cost of care per child. This includes medical procedures and a care pack consisting of PJ’s, slippers, toiletries, and toys (books, puzzles, crayons and colouring books).
