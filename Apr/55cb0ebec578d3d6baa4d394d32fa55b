This is particularly true for merchants in fashion, beauty, education and digital goods, according to online payment service provider PayU, the fintech and e-payments business of Prosus.This evolution has seen the emergence of more digitally savvy shoppers with strong demand for globally sourced goods and services in regions where parts of the population have access to increasing disposable income. These factors make Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa particularly interesting for emerging e-commerce leaders from outside these markets. Fast-growing consumer sectorsThese are the key findings in a new report published by PayU titled 'The Next Frontier: the most promising markets for emerging e-commerce leaders in 2021 and beyond'. The report highlights unprecedented consumer spending growth in e-commerce in high-growth markets that have often been overlooked before 2020 in favour of more traditional Western markets.PayU conducted data analysis in 19 countries – including South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria – across five continents on four of the fastest-growing consumer sectors where PayU sees the biggest growth potential over coming years: Beauty and Cosmetics (haircare, fragrances, personal care, skincare and make-up); Digital Goods (digital music, video on demand platforms, streaming platforms, video and audio-conferencing platforms, and e-publishing); Fashion and Gallantry (apparel, footwear and bags and accessories), and Education (online courses, professional educational services, school publishing, and school and universities fees).Ecommerce potential in AfricaAmong the three African countries included in the report, South Africa has the highest internet penetration at 56%, with Nigeria and Kenya at 46% and 31% respectively. However, e-commerce penetration is at 37% in both Nigeria and South Africa, and at 25% in Kenya. This highlights significant potential for growth in e-commerce in these markets. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/607374.jpg" alt="African countries reach tipping point for e-commerce adoption - PayU data" width="600" height="180">The data reveals that Nigeria is by far the largest e-commerce market on the African continent in terms of the number of shoppers and revenue, with predicted consumer spend via this channel expected to be several times those of South Africa and Kenya combined. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/607375.jpg" alt="African countries reach tipping point for e-commerce adoption - PayU data" width="600" height="300">However, Kenya is primed for a boom in e-commerce, with the digital goods sector forecast to expand by 94% from 2019 levels by the end of 2021, and the fashion and gallantry sector expected to grow by a massive 160% over the same time. In South Africa, the market is embracing digitalisation and e-commerce, and there are abundant opportunities across every sector, but particularly for specialist merchants in beauty and cosmetics, and fashion and gallantry. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/605354-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Credit: Getty" width="120" height="120">Consumers spent $900bn more at online retailers globally in 2020Covid-19 accelerated e-commerce around the globe and forced retailers to shift to digital...14 Apr 2021“2020 was a year that lit a fire beneath online payments in South Africa, transforming e-commerce while creating immense economic pressure,” says Karen Nadasen, CEO of PayU South Africa. “There is growing attention on our continent, increased investment from large international brands and payment platforms.
