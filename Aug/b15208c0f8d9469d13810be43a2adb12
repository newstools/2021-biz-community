The South African edition of the study, set to go infield in August 2021, is sponsored by Triton Digital, the global technology and services agency for the digital audio and podcast industry, in association with the National Association Of Broadcasters’ (NAB) Commercial Radio Committee. BRC CEO, Gary Whitaker, said, “The Infinite Dial study, which debuted in 2019, explores the consumption of audio among South Africans living within the major metro commercial areas, covering the upper two of the three SEM Supergroups (or upper three of the five SEM Clusters).” This year, due to Covid, the research will be accomplished by Computer Aided Telephonic Interviews (CATI) as opposed to the face-to-face interviews completed in 2019. A total of (at least) 1,500 consumers, aged 15+, will be interviewed with the data weighted to reflect the gender, age, and race of the metropolitan population. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2108/622351.jpg" alt="FCB launches new campaign for Coca-Cola that connects Africa's youth through music" width="120" height="120">FCB launches new campaign for Coca-Cola that connects Africa's youth through musicCoca-Cola has always been about music and connecting people through the power of refreshment.

The study will provide broadcasters, online audio publishers, podcasters, advertisers and the financial community with insightful data around South African consumption of streaming radio, online music and podcasts, as well as the usage of smart speakers and more.” As demonstrated in the 2019 study, the continued power of broadcast media remains clear thanks mainly to its ability to keep up with and to navigate the digital world. Considering that the previous study was conducted before Covid, consumers' demand and appetite for entertainment and news has grown significantly, especially through technologies and platforms that enable easier and more accessible content. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2108/621854.jpg" alt="East Coast Radio celebrates 4 wins at the virtual Radio Awards 2021" width="120" height="120">East Coast Radio celebrates 4 wins at the virtual Radio Awards 2021East Coast Radio is beaming with pride after bagging four awards at the prestigious Radio Awards ceremony held virtually...Issued by East Coast Radio 2 days ago For example, United Stations’ audio streaming grew by 100% to one million streams per month across its network of radio stations and websites since the start of the pandemic and Jacaranda FM held the record for the most podcast downloads in a single day towards the end of 2019. Some of the highlights from the 2019 survey indicate that 44% of radio listening at home by the South African major metro commercial population was on a non-radio device, 39% listened to online audio in the past month and, while still in its infancy in South Africa, 22% are aware of podcasting, and 19% of the population have ever listened to a podcast. “Technology is permanently evolving! In South Africa, the cost of data is coming down and broadband is becoming more and more accessible to the average person. Broadcast media is perfectly positioned to take advantage of these positive changes, especially in a post-Covid world,” said Whitaker. For more information on the BRC, go here.
