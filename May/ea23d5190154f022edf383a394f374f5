Our digimag has had over one million views making it an obvious choice for homeowners to turn to for advice and assistance.  It’s also a convenient way for customers to find you. Your company appears in our index and takes customers straight to you! The magazine also offers advertisers opportunities to book a space on one of the many pages dedicated to advertisers to make their mark in our digimag.  Advertorials can also give your company a boost and are a form of advertising that looks like editorial content. They’re articles written for your brand and published alongside regular editorial content produced by the Homemakers content writer. According to the Alexa Blog, “today’s audiences are ripe for advertorials. That is because audiences consume copious amounts of content and will at least skim articles about topics they’re interested in. When you combine that with the value that advertorials offer readers – a chance to learn something, to get to know a brand – they’re more likely to save and share an article, consider you a subject-matter expert, and engage with and remember your brand.”Reach out to a Homemakers sales executive to give you more information about our digimag and connect with a whole new universe of customers.
