In a recent survey, UK based marketing platform, Creativebrief, stated that there is a real fear amongst agencies of long-term client relationships being at risk of ‘extinction’. Creativebrief canvassed 50 brand Chief Marketing Officers and 50 agency Chief Executive Officers. The results indicate that agencies and brands are not on the same page when it comes to the future health of relationships. 65% of agency CEOs said they feared such relationships were under threat compared with 38% of CMOs.In the survey, both agencies and brands agreed that "trust", "openness", "transparency" and "shared goals" scored highly as important conditions that lead to thriving brand/agency partnerships. However, agency bosses feel they are getting the "raw end of the deal" when it comes to client/agency relationships.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/618922.png" alt="Industry maverick to talk honesty at Nedbank IMC 2021" width="600" height="152">But how do we get back to basics?
