In my view, the industry is responding well, considering the circumstances. For me, protecting people is the number one priority while sustaining business performance remains a key focus as our clients continue to navigate recovery and rethink demand strategies. We need to stay responsive in how we operate internally and how we partner with clients to find fit-for-purpose solutions to their business challenges. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about your career and industry?I love the dynamism of our industry. I also love the space I have to reinvent myself and grow continually. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us a bit about your background/experience and how this has equipped you for the role.I spent the first four years of my career in Trade Marketing (Unilever & Kimberley Clark) before moving into Strategic Consulting, where most of my experience lies. Strategic thinking remained a dominant competency as my career progressed from trade marketing to insight-led brand marketing to organisational transformation and human-centric customer experience. I credit my years in consulting for teaching me how to get the best out of people and bring together different perspectives to solve problems. So, my experience's compound effect lies in using the power of human understanding and insight to fuel strategies that grow people and transform businesses. That is what I bring to this role.   .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s at the top of your to-do list?Taking time to listen to our clients and our teams.
