The dissertation highlights the politics of black hair and hairstyling practices and choices, interrogating the dynamics of beauty within various socio-specific communities in Africa and the diaspora. The exhibition features an array of artworks stemming from multiple disciplines by 14 contemporary South African artists. These include sculptures, drawings, paintings, pyrography, photography, and digital illustrations, all reflective of the diverse nature of black women’s hairstyles.
