BCX has asked us to help them embark on their journey of customer-focused strategy and digital transformation. This challenge of digital transformation in a quickly changing business landscape is one that we are helping many of our other clients navigate and win at.” The RFP took the shape of an increasingly fresh approach. Through the pitch process, BCX has consolidated the number of agency suppliers into a single lead agency to improve efficiencies and deliver a more consistent and powerful message to the consumer.  Mandisa Ntloko-Petersen, BCX chief marketing officer, added: “One of the key requirements on the account will be to implement what has become an increasingly specialised B2B marketing strategy in the form of account-based marketing. An agency needs to appreciate the interplay and relationship between marketing and sales teams and the role that technology solutions, marketing stacks and content play in such a strategy. Wunderman Thompson SA is perfectly suited to this delivery – its capabilities as part-creative, part -consultancy and part-tech firm will be instrumental in helping BCX achieve its vision.” Murphy expressed: “BCX’s forward-thinking approach to B2B marketing is going to make all the difference, not just for BCX, but for all its clients too. They are themselves practising what they preach, and the benefit of that, ultimately, will be their own clients’ growth.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/611431.jpg" alt="Targeting communications to counter Covid misinformation" width="120" height="120">Targeting communications to counter Covid misinformationAn international study to track where young people are getting their information about Covid-19 and how and what they are sharing across their extensive global networks, was conducted across 24 countries by agency Wunderman Thompson, University of Melbourne and Pollfish survey platform, in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO)...Issued by Wunderman Thompson 26 May 2021BCX is the ICT converged solutions business within the broader Telkom Group (roots lie in Business Connexion, founded in 1996 and acquired by Telkom in 2015).
