When people are scrolling through your social media channels, they might not differentiate between your personal views vs. your company’s views. If you are an executive with strong views on certain matters, it is very advisable to have a disclaimer on your profile about views on your social media channels being yours and not that of your company.You never want to comment on any racial, sexual, sexist and homophobic content on your timeline. For you as an executive, social media is not the right place to express your views or feelings. They might be taken out of context, and this could lead you and your company you work for into disrepute. Frequency of your postingAs stated before, you must treat your social media channels as business channels and professionally. Therefore, posting frequently will not help your personal brand as businesses do not post frequently as well.

Plus it is just not a good look to have a mature executive posting so much during the workday when they suppose to be too busy working towards helping their company growType of comments you allow on your channelsAs an executive, you must not allow all types of comments on your page. Delete and block comments that will not help your personal brand grow. To have healthy debates that do not involve vulgar, racial slurs or any form of discrimination is accepted, however certain comments must not live on your posts for more than one minute after being posted.

Before you are an executive, you are a brother, a friend, a son or even a daughter, and to those who know you personally, they might not understand the professional content you want to be tagged in on your pages. It is very crucial that you gate keep every post you are tagged in before it goes live on your timeline. You want to avoid being tagged in images and videos that are inappropriate.“Being aware of social media etiquette and ensuring that you always apply such behaviour in your personal and professional online space is key to ensuring that your personal image is always protected and helps avoid your company trending for the wrong reasons,” concludes Vangile.
