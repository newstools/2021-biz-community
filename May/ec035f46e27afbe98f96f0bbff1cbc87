This is where we came in. We took the Avroy Shlain ethos - True Beauty Shines - to a whole new level with our big idea where we added an intrinsic emotion to it: True Beauty shines when you Believe. Meaning true beauty comes from the inside-out. The more you believe the more it shines. In order to elevate Avroy Shlain and the notable makeup, fragrance, body care and skincare brands they market to greater heights,  we had to create a strategy to relate to consumers on a personal level and increase brand awareness, brand growth and most importantly brand alignment. What did we accomplish with the campaign?To achieve the best results with the True Beauty Shines When You Believe campaign, we used a 360-degree integrated approach. We utilised different mediums to tell the story, from social to digital, television and activations on each platform – each being an extension of the last. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/608038.jpg" alt="True beauty shines when you believe - The Avroy Shlain Journey" width="650" height="626">The fruitful journey was evident in the results we achieved, where we noted a considerable increase in website visits, brochure downloads and lead generation since the start of the 2018.
