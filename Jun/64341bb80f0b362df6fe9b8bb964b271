Here's how to limit social media usage...Turn off “Push” notifications Soon as our phone makes a sound, we are straight away drawn to it. Push notifications attached to social media apps can be disabled and to reduce social media intake, it would be wise to do so. Less notification sounds and lights via social media apps is more than likely to have a position impact on your productivity and concentration levels. Daily social media detox Set yourself a daily goal where you delegate at least an hour of the day when you are awake to not use social media at all. This can be during the morning, lunch or at night – whatever hour slot works best for you. It is an excellent way to detach yourself from social media and reduce your reliance on it. Maybe in that hour find yourself a hobby which does not involve staring at a screen.Have a productive approach With social media it can be easy to get drawn into pointless debates or become fixated by comedy memes/videos but why not make your time spent on social media productive. There are a ton of educational influencers from a range of areas such as finance and technology, so why not follow those in subject areas you have a genuine interest in and absorb their content to gain valuable knowledge.
