It looks at key moments in our history, speaking to people who were at the forefront of historical shifts and explores how our worlds have changed in the past seven decades.Ntate Caiphus Semenya and Mama Letta Mbulu take us into the townships of their youth. Internationally acclaimed actor John Kani tells us how he felt the first time he saw his name and face in Drum and Ma Lillian Diedericks – one of the women who led the iconic Women’s March on 9 August 1956 – tells us about that tumultuous time.There are also breathtaking images of powerful protests, a celebration of love with weddings over the years, fashions through the ages and so much more.This magazine is a must for anyone who wants to share South Africa’s history with their children or just remember and reflect on how far we’ve come. “The Drum 70th birthday magazine isn’t just a trip down memory lane – it’s a celebration of seven decades of telling people’s stories, the right way,” says Thulani Gqirana, editor of Drum.“Drum is part of South Africa’s rich history and with this book, we take you back but also show you what the future holds for this amazing brand.
