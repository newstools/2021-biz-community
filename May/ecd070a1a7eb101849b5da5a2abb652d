We're sure to continue the trend which has given LG the title of the world’s best-selling OLED brand for the past eight consecutive years. Our Self-Lit OLED TV delivers the best ‘hometainment’ experience, with the TV lineup for South Africa in 2021 promising to be the most impressive yet!”Their OLED TVs (series Z1, G1, C1, A1) are the best for picture quality currently on the market, with self-lit pixel technology that produces ultra-sharp and ultra-realistic images with smooth, natural motion. All the OLED G1 series models and above, now feature LG’s futuristic new OLED evo technology – the next step in the evolution of OLED TVs.
