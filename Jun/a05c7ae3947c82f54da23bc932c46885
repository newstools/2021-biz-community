This human-centric approach gets to the root of why people do what they do, versus what they say they do.Utilising the latest video and mobile content creation platforms, Nude will ensure that projects are implemented quickly and efficiently, with the aim of eliminating the lengthy timing and budgetary constraints associated with traditional research. Says Potterton, MD of Nude, “The industry seems to be infatuated with collecting more and more data, however we seem to have forgotten that consumers are people and are by nature irrational and unpredictable. We hope to take clients beyond the data points and into the lives of real people. We want to shape, not measure opinions.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/607729-120x120.jpg?2" alt="BREAKING: Duke Group launches Duchess" width="120" height="120">BREAKING: Duke Group launches DuchessIn a first for female empowerment and for South African business, the Duke Group has launched Duchess - a 100% Black female-owned, Level 1 BBBEE-compliant, full-service production facilitator, committed to connecting industry needs and ideas with a network of production specialists, giving first option to female experts...3 May 2021With the global perspective gained from launching Instant Grass in both the North American and Asia Pacific markets, Potterton realised that a South African partner was needed to truly unlock the potential of the sub-Saharan African markets.
