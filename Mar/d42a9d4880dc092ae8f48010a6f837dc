As an award-winning multidisciplinary producer, he brings years of film experience to his role as Jury President.  Jesse built a career on traditional advertising done in nontraditional ways. He produced some of the earliest award-winning viral films for Ray-Ban, Adidas, and Motorola. At Droga5, Jesse leads campaigns for clients including Under Armour, Google, Johnsonville and the highly regarded Hennessy V.S.O.P film “Harmony. Mastered from Chaos.”Brihn had this to say about what he will be looking for when judging entries this year: “I do think it’s going to be a competitive year despite Covid. I think there’s a lot of great work done this year…it’s hard to say what’s going to resonate until you see it. The things that speak to me are the ones that can connect this idea of art in what we do and how we communicate, and the idea of what the client is intending to do and how it’s being supported in this form of art and how they come together. If you feel passionate and it’s worth a conversation, then you should share it.”2021 Film Craft Executive JuryJury President: Jesse Brihn, Director of Film & Content Production, Droga5 USAAdam Britton, Managing Director & Creative Director, Trunk UKSonja Davies, President, Jaxx CanadaManir Fadel, CCO, VMLY&R Spain Erica Ford, Executive Producer, Buck Australia Sandy Haddad, Partner / Executive Producer, Chromista USADiego de la Maza, EVP/Head of Production, Deutsch LA USALuisa Murray, Executive Producer, Buck USATatiana Rudzinski, Executive Producer, Greenpoint Pictures USAMel Senecal, VP, Executive Producer, McCann NY USAClairellen Wallin, Executive Producer, The Mill USAAll entries into the 2021 NYF Advertising Awards competition will be judged by 400+ members of NYF’s Executive Jury and Grand Jury, a panel of prominent global creative minds, who collectively select the World’s Best Advertising.To view the entire Film Craft Executive Jury visit nyfadvertising.com.
