TikTok’s goal is to make it easy for parents to understand how the platform works and the tools they can use to create the best experience for their family. A guardian's guide to TikTok As TikTok works to support families on the platform, it’s introducing the Guardian's Guide, a one-stop-shop to learn all about TikTok. This includes how to get started on the platform, the safety and privacy tools, such as the Family Pairing features, and additional resources to address common online safety questions. TikTok understands that every teen and family is different, which is why it offers a range of choices and settings to empower parents and caregivers who are looking for easy ways to engage in their teen's life online.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/609341.png" alt="TikTok's digital safety guides for families" width="243" height="403">Bullying education and prevention resourcesTikTok is a global community that thrives on creativity and expression, and it's critical that people feel safe to express themselves without fear of bullying or harassment. To educate families and the broader TikTok community on ways to protect against the harms of online bullying, TikTok has developed a bullying prevention guide in partnership with a range of global experts, including the Cyberbullying Research Centre, Net Family News, and TikTok's US Content Advisory Council. The guide offers information to help people identify bullying, tools to combat harassment, and local resources to get help if someone is being bullied. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/609343.png" alt="TikTok's digital safety guides for families" width="263" height="436">Videos on TikTok’s approach to platform safety TikTok’s approach to safety spans policies, products, and partners as the platform builds a community where creativity and creative expression can thrive.
