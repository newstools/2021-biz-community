OFM is driven to surprise and delight the listener and July presents one of three campaigns in 2021 that celebrate OFM’s 35th birthday.“The suspense of the Secret Song should create a lot of talkability among OFM’s listening audience,” concludes Thabethe.In the spirit of giving, OFM will waive our 60-day winning rule, meaning that should you have won anything on OFM’s platforms in the last 60 days, you will still be eligible to enter the Secret Song competition. Other general competition rules will still apply and can be found on OFM’s website.Although there is only one grand prize of R35,000 cash, all finalists will receive limited edition retro OFM memorabilia in celebration of our 35th birthday year.The grand prize winner will be announced on OFM on 30 July 2021, during the Good Morning Breakfast, between 6am and 9am.Why OFM?
