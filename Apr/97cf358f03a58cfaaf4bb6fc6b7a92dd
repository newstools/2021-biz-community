So we are also using this campaign to encourage consumers to be more intentional about their apparel choices: to wear each item longer, for example, to buy secondhand or to use our in-store Tailor Shops to extend the life of their garments,” says Jennifer Sey, brand president. “As a company that has celebrated pioneers and aspired to bring inventive environmental solutions to the market, we saw our voice in these young leaders. Change will come if we all work together and we’re humbled to partner with them in reducing our collective impact on the planet.”Buy Better, Wear Longer also encapsulates Levi’s® ongoing efforts to drive more sustainable production practices: by driving ambitious climate and water action and by investing in materials and technologies such as Cottonised hemp and organic cotton, and scaling Water We recognise that fashion production and consumption have reached unsustainable levels: between 2005 and 2020, global clothing consumption doubled. We have more items in our wardrobes, but we wear each garment fewer times. And then we are far too quick to toss it out, keeping clothing for almost half as long as we did 15 years ago. That’s why we’re rallying together to call for 'Buy Better, Wear Longer' — with the recognition that we have work to do ourselves. Our campaign partners share both our passion for this effort and our sense of urgency. Emma Chamberlain is a leading voice among her generation.

It puts us in this bad cycle. I’m glad that Levi’s® is changing that message by making thrifting cool. Some of my favorite pairs are thrifted. And I’m even more happy to see that Levi’s® is supporting these amazing young voices who are all speaking up for the environment.” — Jaden SmithIn addition to these cultural icons, three young activists are putting their words into actions: Melati Wijsen, a 20-year-old Indonesian social entrepreneur, co-founded a non-profit that successfully campaigned to ban plastic bags from Bali in 2019 and is focusing now on empowering youth. Xiye Bastida, born and raised in San Pedro Tultepec, Mexico, a town stricken by both drought and floods, knows first-hand what climate change can bring and is taking to the streets to fight for a more planet-friendly future. Indigenous climate activist and hip-hop artist Xiuhtezcatl has produced tracks like "What the Frack'' and "Speak for the Trees", where he blends music with environmental justice.“The climate crisis is the biggest threat that we have but it’s also the biggest opportunity we have to move forward.” — Xiye Bastida<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/606008.jpg" alt="Xiye Bastida identifies climate change as the biggest threat" width="719" height="944">Xiye Bastida identifies climate change as the biggest threatThe Buy Better, Wear Longer campaign will be carried out on all Levi's® platforms – digital, social and broadcast – globally in an effort to share this message far and wide, and as a reminder that a sustainable future is one where companies and consumers around the world come together to rethink fashion.
