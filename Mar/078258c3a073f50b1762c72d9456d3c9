Prizes to be won! “Unicef is committed to improving outcomes in science-based subjects, such as mathematics, for all learners, especially girls. Mathematics provides not only foundational but also critical functional skills and opportunities for children as they develop and transition into their working lives. Growing up with these attributes, children will themselves create a more equal and inclusive workforce that provides relevant skills. The Covid-19 pandemic and the related vaccine development has again highlighted why science based subjects are so important in helping to build a better world for all,” said Christine Muhigana, Unicef South Africa representative.  "The Rotary Club of Northcliff (District 9400) is proud to be associated with the International Day of Mathematics. Maths is incredibly important in our lives and, without realising it, we use mathematical concepts, as well as the skills we learn from doing math problems every day. We welcome your participation and trust that you will gain valuable insights from this programme."- Mr Andrew Buttress, president of NRC  Event details:  Date: 20 March 2021Venue: UJ Campus (virtual - details to be sent after registration)Time: 10am-12pm
