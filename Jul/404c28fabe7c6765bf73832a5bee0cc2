Customers can enjoy the flavours of three different buckets, each for the price of just ‘three tiger’. For those of you who don’t know, ‘three tiger’ is what those of us ‘in the know’ call R30. KFC and agency partner, Ogilvy Johannesburg, are bringing on the celebration in a very extravagant way! To bring the idea of ‘when you know, you know’ to life, the agency needed to enlist the help of a giant, and so the collaboration with talented director Karien Cherry began. Together with her big thinking and vision, the team closed the busy streets of Jozi for a memorable two-day shoot. There was smoke, fire, people running for their dear lives, car crashes and even a falling billboard. What they created on set can simply be described as cinematic brilliance in the form of a 45-second-long television commercial, all in the name of fun, excitement and good food. Creative director at Ogilvy Johannesburg, Mpumi Guliwe, says: “With the boldness to talk to streetwise South Africans in a language that only they understand, we elevate people who are in the know; with an idea which is reflected by the characters of our ad!” The new offering from KFC is a collection of three dope Streetwise® Bucket for 1 meals from which each customer can choose, all in a bucket sporting a locally inspired design by artist @SlayingGoliath. These meals are available for a limited time only and are made for the person who can spot a good deal from a mile away. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/618782.jpg" alt="Elevate 'boss time' with the Streetwise Bucket for 1 Trio" width="1200" height="300">The meals include the Original Streetwise® Bucket for 1, which has a piece of Original Recipe™ chicken, two Zinger™ wings, small chips plus a free small Coca-Cola No Sugar. Then there is the Wingz Bucket for 1, which has four Zinger™ wings, small chips and a free small Coca-Cola No Sugar. And not forgetting the Nuggz Bucket for 1 that comes with a chicken piece, two nuggets, small chips and a free small Coca-Cola No Sugar. Pick one for a young ’three tiger’. KFC marketing director Grant Macpherson also added: “For the past 50 years, we have taken great pride in serving our guests the best tasting chicken at the best price. At the heart of this great value is our Streetwise® range, a cultural icon in South Africa. In 2021, we will continue to celebrate the Streetwise® through the launch of our new Streetwise® Bucket for 1 Trio range. Massive shout out to my fantastic team – Hloni Mohope, Lynette Ngwata and our awesome partner, Ogilvy – for always staying culturally connected, creating awesome creative while driving strong business results." <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/610307-120x120.jpg?10" alt="KFC launches new spot advertising spicy zinger nuggets" width="120" height="120">KFC launches new spot advertising spicy zinger nuggetsKFC South Africa is bringing the heat with a new spot to launch its spicy zinger nuggets...20 May 2021Now that all the hard work has been done, it’s time for Mzansi to unleash their ‘three tigers’ and go try out the new KFC Streetwise® Bucket for 1 Trio.
