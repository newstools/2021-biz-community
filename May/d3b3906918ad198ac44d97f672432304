The public broadcaster confirmed the news on its Twitter account...30 Mar 2021 SABC 2 head of channel, Gerhard Pretorious, said, “After 23 years on air, the time has come to say goodbye to Pasella. The decision has been a hard one, but it is necessary with the new schedule introduced in April this year, aimed at diversifying SABC 2’s Afrikaans magazine offering and providing our audiences with fresh, entertaining, varied and relevant local content. This will also enable the channel to showcase different stories which represent the diversity of our nation and offer more opportunities for independent producers to bring their creative works to the channel. To the Tswelopele Production team, thank you for sharing this wonderful ‘gift’ with the channel and our audiences for 21 years! Viewers can look forward to a season finale where we take them down memory lane as we look back at Pasella over the years.”  The season will close off with a Pasella family party. All the current presenters, Pasella friends and some of the behind-the-scenes crew and staff will be invited. All to bid Pasella a proper, heartfelt goodbye.
