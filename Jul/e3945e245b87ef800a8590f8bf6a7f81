Could you comment on the impact of Covid-19 on the industry?Covid-19 has had an impact at both industry levels and organisational levels. Studies done globally have revealed that digital adoption has taken a quantum leap as we have been forced to move toward digital channels because of the restrictions placed by pandemic lockdowns. “You are on mute” was not a part of our daily lives pre-Covid-19. However, from a marketing point of view, we have not been immune to the economic impact of Covid-19. An ailing economy, reduced consumer spending, organisations reporting losses all eventually lead to marketing budget cuts. We have had to innovate with less and find new ways of making our digital marketing efforts connect more with people beyond just the sales objective. In addition to that, an increase in digital activity also means an increase in digital clutter. The competitive pool has new powerful entrants in the form of content creators, influencers etc. To be seen and heard requires more innovative thinking and an understanding of how to use digital tools to get our marketing objective across. For me, overall, the greatest learning has been in adapting to change as a constant variable. This has allowed me to understand even more profoundly, the powerful role of consumer led creativity in a digital a world. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}As the world of advertising has shifted, digital has grown and evolved into a channel that delivers real business results through this evolution. What can organisations no longer ignore?Consumers have moved dramatically toward online channels. While this has obviously had a positive impact on the industry, we have had to respond adequately. Brands that failed to do so, are getting left behind. I think more and more brands have come to understand that a digital strategy should be a part of the fabric of the organisational strategy as well. A key shift in response to consumer behaviour has been an increase in the digitisation of consumer interactions and offerings. Some of these transitions will be the foundation of a new way of doing business that will stick in the long term. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}The IAB Bookmark Awards celebrate ‘13 years of moving the industry forward this year. How has this platform contributed to the evolution of digital marketing excellence? 13 years ago, was 2008. Facebook hadn’t launched the like button yet, and Instagram did not even exist. To be a platform that contributed to digital marketing for this long is something worth celebrating. Not only does IAB as a whole, empower the media and marketing industries to thrive in a digital economy, they also enable excellence. The Bookmarks are a result of that. The more we empower, acknowledge and celebrate digital excellence, the more we innovate. This is how the industry keeps moving forward.
