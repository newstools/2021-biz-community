<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/613302-625x325.png?2" alt="Source:" width="625" height="325">Source: www.inma.orgIn a ceremony broadcast via INMA.org, YouTube, and Facebook Live, INMA revealed 58 first-place winners across 20 categories aimed at surfacing innovation and best practices in news brands, optimising the use of media platforms, subscriptions, business development, and data and insights. The Global Media Awards competition announcement was supported by the Google News Initiative. Winning the coveted “Best In Show” was Mittelbayerische Zeitung and its collaborative “Drive” initiative of regional German publishers sharing data, resources, and insights to support their digital subscription strategy. Judges selected from finalists the best in six world regions:Best in Africa: Nation Media Group for “Nation Leadership Forum”Best in Asia/Pacific: Stuff for “Ta Matou Pono, Our Truth”Best in Europe: Mittelbayerische Zeitung for "Drive”Best in Latin America: El Colombiano for “Dame tres minutos y te explico”Best in North America: The Globe and Mail for “Fully dynamic, personalised, real-time paywall”Best in South Asia: The Hindustan Times for “Hindustan Times Code-a-Thon: India's Largest Coding Olympiad”Eleven companies won multiple first-place awards. Russmedia in Austria took home five top prizes, followed by Amedia in Norway with three first places. Nine others garnered two first places: Aftenposten, Funke Mediengruppe, Göteborgs-Posten, Hindustan Times, News Corp Australia, Newsday Media Group, Nine, NZME, and Ringier Axel Springer. The 2021 Global Media Awards competition garnered 644 entries from 212 news media brands in 37 countries. Participants included newspaper media, magazine media, digital media, television media, and radio media. The INMA competition evaluates news media companies across three segments: national brands, regional brands, and – for the first time – media groups. INMA has presented awards for media excellence since 1937. Earl J. Wilkinson, executive director and CEO of INMA, said, “Not surprisingly, the outstanding entries in this year’s competition leaned heavily into Covid responses along with shifting priorities during a tumultuous year: product, data and subscriptions. Another underlying theme was about communicating the values held by news brands amid the misinformation explosion and the rise of algorithms, data and machine learning in the everyday running of a media company.” Typically announced at a closing dinner at INMA’s World Congress of News Media, this year’s announcement was virtual for a second straight year due to the global pandemic and featured Jamaican TV host Terri-Karelle Reid as emcee with analysis by Robbie Brown of the Google News Initiative. The awards were announced by members of INMA’s Young Professionals Committee: Mari-Marthe Aamold of Bergens Tidende and Stavanger Aftenblad, Norway; Brinda Kumar of HT Media, India; Katharina Neubert of Business Insider, United States; Nicholas O’Connor of AméricaEconomía, Chile; Saarah Survé representing Independent Media in South Africa; Belle Tayler of Nine, Australia; and Tee Zhuo of The Business Times, Singapore.
