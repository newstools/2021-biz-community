These will set a benchmark against which the company can meet and improve their efforts as new solutions come to market.“One of our major drives is to promote the use of printed fabric graphics to our clients,” says Wagener. “They provide the ideal solution for reusable exhibition displays as they can be compacted for storage, transported in small tubes or parcels and installed quickly and easily without the need for tools. “While some may argue that face-to-face meetings are a thing of the past in our digitally connected, globalised world, in-person meetings and trade events are of vital importance to get decisions made and drive progress in any discipline,” she asserts, adding that working with clients to reduce their ecological footprint means not only opting for digital where appropriate, but always following current best practise to outweigh the cons of the travel and materials involved. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1404/188574-120x120.jpg" alt="WTM Africa launches Responsible Tourism Programme" width="120" height="120">WTM Africa launches Responsible Tourism ProgrammeWTM Africa is launching its WTM Africa Responsible Tourism Programme, which will form a key component of the education sessions, taking place from 2-3 May 2014 at the Cape Town International Convention Centre.3 Apr 2014Digital as a contributor to greening According to Wagener, digital has enabled Reed Exhibitions Africa a number of opportunities to implement planet-friendly options.

As a responsible company, we constantly monitor ways to help exhibitors go green, while keeping an eye on our own sustainability.
