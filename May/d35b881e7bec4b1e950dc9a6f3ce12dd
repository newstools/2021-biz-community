It was hard won and without it, we cannot hope to flourish,”– H.E. RamaphosaThe month of May celebrates Workers’ Day in South Africa. Our nation recognises this day, since the elections of 1994, as a celebration of workers’ rights and as a reminder of the critical role that trade unions, the Communist Party and other labour organisations played in the fight against Apartheid. Worker’s Day holds much cultural significance for our nation and the sacrifices that have been made surrounding employment standards. And even though it fell on a weekend this year, there’s still tons to look out for the rest of the month.May is, additionally, Africa Month and we’ll be celebrating Africa Day on 25 May, as we look back at all the strides made by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) the precursor to the African Union (AU). The establishment of this organisation marked the continent of Africa as a pioneer in focusing on continental unity and encouraging nation building behaviour.African unity and building our nation are, therefore, the underpinning themes running through this bumper May edition of Public Sector Leaders.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/610219.jpg" alt="Energy and Africa Month unite: Public Sector Leaders (PSL) May edition out now" width="950" height="950">Inside this edition: In this edition, we look at South Africa’s energy mix and the way forward for the country’s power supply.
