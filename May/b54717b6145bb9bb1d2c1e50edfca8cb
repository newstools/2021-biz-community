As global executive creative director and global creative council president at McCann Worldgroup, based in New York, Mescall will oversee the Film and Video Stars categories.

It’s a global festival that’s based in a corner of the globe that’s renowned for innovation, technology and culture, and I’m curious to discover ideas I’ve never imagined from creators I’ve never encountered before,” says Mescall. Before relocating to New York in 2014, he was CCO of McCann Australia, leading McCann Melbourne to become the world’s most awarded agency in 2013. Today, he provides creative leadership across McCann's global brands, and works closely with the network’s creative and strategic leaders across all markets.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/612122.jpg" alt="Gabriela Scardaccione" width="264" height="400">Gabriela ScardaccioneScardaccione adds: “I’ve heard that Ad Stars is different from other awards shows – the festival has an interesting purpose and seems committed to supporting creatives by offering an awards platform that’s free to enter.
