We’re blessed with the ability to help communities in our area and the priority for us was to get Westside up and running again. After all, they’re also part of the greater radio industry family in South Africa.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/620513.jpg" alt="Hot 102.7FM helps Westside FM get back on air" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/2107/620514.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="700" data-lheight="526" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/620515.jpg" alt="Hot 102.7FM helps Westside FM get back on air" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/2107/620516.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="700" data-lheight="526" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/620517.jpg" alt="Hot 102.7FM helps Westside FM get back on air" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/2107/620518.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="700" data-lheight="522" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/620519.jpg" alt="Hot 102.7FM helps Westside FM get back on air" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/2107/620521.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="700" data-lheight="526" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/620522.jpg" alt="Hot 102.7FM helps Westside FM get back on air" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/2107/620523.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="700" data-lheight="526" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/620524.jpg" alt="Hot 102.7FM helps Westside FM get back on air" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/2107/620525.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="700" data-lheight="526" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/620526.jpg" alt="Hot 102.7FM helps Westside FM get back on air" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/2107/620527.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="700" data-lheight="526" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/620528.jpg" alt="Hot 102.7FM helps Westside FM get back on air" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/2107/620529.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="700" data-lheight="522" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/620532.jpg" alt="Hot 102.7FM helps Westside FM get back on air" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/2107/620533.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="700" data-lheight="526" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/620534.jpg" alt="Hot 102.7FM helps Westside FM get back on air" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/2107/620535.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="700" data-lheight="526" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/620536.jpg" alt="Hot 102.7FM helps Westside FM get back on air" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/2107/620537.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="700" data-lheight="526" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Although Westside FM had managed to get back on air in a rudimentary fashion, the station needed several items of equipment including soundcards; a computer; microphones, headphones, and a computer monitor. Through relationships with various equipment and component suppliers, Hot Cares was able to procure the required items and these were handed over to a delighted Ledwaba at the Hot 102.7FM offices by Lloyd Madurai and Carmen Rocha.“For Hot 102.7FM, it’s an honour to be able to assist our fellow broadcasters and to give back to the community,” says Madurai. “We love the radio industry, we’re privileged to be able to do what we do and we are blessed with the ability to give back to our friends in need.”“I’m so happy that we will soon be able to give our community the programming that they have come to expect from Westside,” said Ledwaba. “I was despondent after the destruction of our facilities, which were built at a cost or R1.4m in 2016, but now I am resolute that we will be back soon – stronger than ever.
