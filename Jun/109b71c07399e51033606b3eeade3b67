In a collaborative effort to educate the local outdoor industry and its stakeholders on the latest innovations within the DOOH realm, media owner Tractor Outdoor recently hosted a free webinar titled “The future of OOH”, together with its partners Broadsign, AdMobilize, voodooh and Hivestack. The webinar – which was hosted on Wednesday, 9 June – featured presentations by Joe Cotugno, senior vice-president: operations at Broadsign; Joe Mora, head of DOOH: EMEA at AdMobilize; Keith Nilsen, founder at voodooh; Romulus Stoian, global director: publisher solutions at Hivestack; and Tractor’s sales director, Lizelle Mc Connell. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/613952-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Tractor Outdoor expands its Cape Town network with more RSD sites" width="120" height="120">Tractor Outdoor expands its Cape Town network with more RSD sitesTractor Outdoor is expanding its roadside presence with an additional three roadside digital (RSD) sites in Cape Town...Issued by Tractor Outdoor 10 Jun 2021Mc Connell explains that through “The Future of OOH” webinar – which is the first in a planned series – the media owner aims to create a platform to educate brands, agencies, marketers and media owners on the exciting new technologies that have emerged. “These tools have the potential to unlock enormous opportunities for marketers; delivering measurable, dynamic campaigns based on real-time audience data.” Tractor Outdoor has also created The DOOH Playbook, a free how-to guide covering the A-Z of DOOH advertising. “The playbook unpacks a number of pertinent topics, such as “Why DOOH needs to be part of your omni-channel strategy”; “How to create the perfect DOOH media plan”; “How to conceptualise creative content in a way that generates returns”; “How to integrate technology into your campaign planning”; and more,” says Mc Connell. Tractor Outdoor’s commercial director Remi du Preez explains that unlocking innovation in order to create impactful campaigns that deliver real results is a key focus of Tractor Outdoor’s business, and “we constantly seek to identify new technologies and platforms that will allow us to deliver on this goal. “We pride ourselves on being one of the forerunners in introducing new tools and technologies to the local industry; driving education, but also helping marketers bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and application."
