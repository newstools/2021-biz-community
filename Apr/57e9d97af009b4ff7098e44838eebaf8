This platform provides African creatives with an opportunity to showcase their work and to be seen and acknowledged by industry leaders.Megan Oberholzer, portfolio director: travel, tourism and creative industries at Reed Exhibitions, says: “Fame Week Africa is proud to partner with the host city of Cape Town, one of the most beautiful cities in the world and the perfect destination to host this innovative show and provides the ideal backdrop to showcase the African creative industries.”The City of Cape Town’s Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security JP Smith adds: “The City of Cape Town has over the years recognised that the creative industries have the potential to be a catalyst for economic growth, job creation and social cohesion. Partnering for initiatives such as Fame Week Africa is part of a broader strategy to provide more platforms for creatives from our city and those from the rest of the country to showcase their talents whether it’s film, the arts or new media.” When planning Fame Week Africa, the organisers took into consideration how the Covid pandemic has changed not only the event landscape but also the creative industries: “Covid-19 has provided us with an opportunity to reimagine events, resulting in various event and exhibitions companies coming together to provide an exceptional offering for exhibitors and visitors,” Oberholzer says. With the landscape reimagined, Fame Week Africa will bring a collaboration of partners that promote synergy in the host city of Cape Town. Says Comic Con Cape Town show director Carla Massmann: “After having to postpone the Comic Con show last year, we’ve been navigating the landscape with caution and creativity. “It makes complete sense to work alongside Fame Week Africa and I’m delighted to announce a one-day Comic Con Pop-up throughout the host city of Cape Town on 11 September 2021. We’ll be bringing a taste of Comic Con to Cape Town and we couldn’t be more excited.”Echoing her sentiments, Dianne Makings, festival director of the Cape Town International Animation Festival adds: "Working independently alongside twoother stand-alone events, Comic Con Cape Town and Fame Week we are offering our communities a unique offering. It truly is an exciting time to be in the African animation industry.”About Fame Week Africa Fame Week Africa 2021 is set to become the continent’s unrivalled cornerstone of business development for the film, arts, media and entertainment industries.
