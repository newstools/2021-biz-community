Ultimately, all the narratives in competition speak to this vision and are an illustration of the challenges of overcoming adversity and adapting to an altered world — one where, sadly, not everyone has fared so well. These are the kinds of stories that Diff sought out this year, stories of hope, stories that show the light at the end of the tunnel, even if for now, it seems like just a flicker,'' said Zhou.
