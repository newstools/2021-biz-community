In 2018, a joint venture was established with the Dentsu Group, in the first substantial investment by a communications multinational in Mozambique, bringing new technologies, tools and digital expertise to the market. During these past 25 years, the agency has evolved as the market opened up to the importance that advertising and marketing has on the impact of businesses, brands and institutions. Talking about the firsts steps of the agency is synonymous with talking about the energy of the ‘90s of rebuilding a new Mozambique.  João dos Santos, the founder, was a pioneer in establishing the agency: “We were there side by side with brands that are crucial to the growth of Mozambique and that is why we had the opportunity to grow with them. We created the first TV campaigns for 2M and Laurentina Beers, the first TV campaigns in the banking sector for BPD, the Jeito brand and the first HIV prevention campaigns, we created the brand identities for Açúcar Nacional and the Maputo Port, we did the rebranding of BSTM to Standard Bank, of Banco Austral to Barclays, the first local campaigns for DSTV and so many more. Fortunately, we have many happy stories to tell, it will always be unfair to single out a client but our 25 year relationship with 2M is something that we are very proud off.”Create’s operating model is built on people and systems focused on client needs, to deliver class-leading communications solutions for brands through a single integrated team that operates seamlessly across the various platforms.
