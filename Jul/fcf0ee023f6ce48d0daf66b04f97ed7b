These are all people who have pushed through barriers of what may have seemed impossible at the time, to go on and achieve at the highest level. Our intention is for the ‘impossible is nothing’ tower to be a beacon of hope that when dreams meet hard work and dedication, anything is possible.” Kirsty Carlson, head of GroupM OOH, adds that the Outdoor Network Tower truly delivers in terms of great iconic impact. “The incredible, colourful and eye-catching artwork that has been created specifically for this Adidas campaign and site really stands out, and delivers even further on the impact and dominance of this ‘impossible is nothing’ campaign message. Truly a great high impact site being used so effectively.” “Spectacular sites such as the tower are distinctly visible and have the ability to elevate the status and image of brands and campaigns through their unique environments, size and scale,” says Mzi Deliwe, deputy CEO of Provantage Media Group. “In this way, dominant sites like these can ultimately amplify brand messaging in a manner other media formats find hard to beat.”The Adidas ‘impossible is nothing’ tower looks set to deliver larger-than-life impact and stake its claim as one of the most visible and impactful OOH campaigns in Johannesburg.To find out more about Outdoor Network, contact az.oc.no@ofni.
