The new programme takes the form of an extended virtual exhibition and individual online profiles on the Design Indaba website. In celebration of the new crop of creatives who have emerged through the submissions and curatorial selection process, Emerging Creatives will include: documentary videography, ongoing social media content on Design Indaba’s thriving channels, masterclass sessions with international and local experts that include UK-based Artsthread, and inclusion on Design Indaba’s soon-to-be-launched Google Arts and Culture presence. Celebrating emerging talentDesign Indaba Emerging Creatives is supported by the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture with the aim of nurturing new talent. The programme successfully functions as a launching pad for careers. Over the years, it has provided a much-needed break for scores of young designers. Design Indaba founder Ravi Naidoo said, “We are extremely committed to this programme. Especially now, with the economic impact of Covid-19, it is vital that we continue to support our youth and aid their entry into the local and global marketplace so that their stars can truly shine. Young talent, with so much potential, needs all the help it can get – and so we are thankful to the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture for providing support for this programme.” Many Design Indaba Emerging Creatives have gone on to achieve global recognition for their projects and brands. Famous names include fashion and homeware label MaXhosa by Laduma Ngxokolo, Kristin-lee Moolman, Thebe Magugu, Rich Mnisi, Katherine-Mary Pichulik of Pichulik, Neo Mahlangu, Andile Dyalvane, Cole Ndelu and a host of others.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/605568-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Design Indaba recruits Thabisa Mjo, Cole Ndelu to select emerging creatives for 2021" width="120" height="120">Design Indaba recruits Thabisa Mjo, Cole Ndelu to select emerging creatives for 2021Design Indaba has recruited Thabisa Mjo and Cole Ndelu to oversee the curation of this year's cohort of young designers...15 Apr 2021In fact, Ndelu is one of this year’s curators, who, alongside fellow curator Thabisa Mjo of Mash T.
