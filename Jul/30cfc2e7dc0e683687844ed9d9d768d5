Together with this Mediamark are also undergoing an internal Mental wellness campaign, something every company should embark on.”Recent research results indicate that 49% of people in the workplace have been adversely impacted during the significant changes and challenges of Covid-19. The recent violence and uncertainty have further compounded anxiety. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/619332-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nelson Mandela Foundation calls on SA to step up this Mandela Day" width="120" height="120">Nelson Mandela Foundation calls on SA to step up this Mandela DayThe Nelson Mandela Foundation is calling on South Africans to honour Madiba this month by stepping up in this moment of great challenge for the country...7 hours agoSADAG’s Kaya Phillips said, “The pandemic has impacted on every aspect of our lives. Some people have lost their jobs, they might be worried about where to stay, others are dealing with trauma and increased anxiety and some people have relapsed as a result of the stress.” SADAG stats reveal that one in three South Africans will have a mental illness at some point in their life.
