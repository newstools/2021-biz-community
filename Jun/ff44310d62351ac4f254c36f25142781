Could you take us through this year's wins for the agency?Massif is a production company and the winning piece, ‘Weird’, for sneaker boutique Shelflife and the ‘Stussy x Nike’ collaboration was done direct-to-client. I wrote and directed the film. It is a two and half minute online film that refreshes the notion and tone of traditional fashion advertising. I believe we achieved our goal of creating an engaging, stylish and darkly amusing tale where the clothes are integrated seamlessly, being key to the plot. The film is a complex balancing act; aesthetically striking, funny – in a smart, off beat way… hypnotic and dreamy. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} What was your previous D&AD "pencil box" record?This was my first win personally and the first for the company, which is nearly four years old..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} Share your strategy to keep those international accolades coming.From a personal perspective, it’s to keep pushing clients, pushing my personal craft – using a win like this as a reminder of what is possible when the stars align.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/611836-120x120.png?2" alt="#D&amp;AD21: D&amp;AD awards 3 Black Pencils, 231 Culture, Design and Impact winners" width="120" height="120">#D&AD21: D&AD awards 3 Black Pencils, 231 Culture, Design and Impact winnersIn the second virtual ceremony, on 27 May at 7pm, D&AD announced 3 Black Pencil winners, alongside the President's Award and the remaining Pencil winners across the Culture, Design and Impact categories...27 May 2021
