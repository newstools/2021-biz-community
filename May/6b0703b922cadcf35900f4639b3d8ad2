Word and actions matter In the exhibition and events industries, Hiller says support of diversity is not only an “in-house business imperative”, but a core ethic that is carried through in all the company’s messaging.“With every show or function we promote, our messaging is by the diverse for the diverse. This is why we believe it’s so important to have people representative of every possible community sector working with us. How could we know the intricacies of diversity if we didn’t have people with first-hand knowledge sharing in our decision making?”Hiller says the diversity at Reed Exhibitions Africa has strengthened the company culture over the years, and given it a reputation for working closely with groups such as LGBTQI+ and other often-marginalised organisations. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/537609.jpg" alt="Reed Exhibitions South Africa walks away with 25 wins at the Roar Awards" width="120" height="120">Reed Exhibitions South Africa walks away with 25 wins at the Roar AwardsReed Exhibitions excelled at the recent AAXO Roar Awards...Issued by Reed Exhibitions 7 Feb 2020“In this regard, we believe that we are a company that makes people feel comfortable working with us.
