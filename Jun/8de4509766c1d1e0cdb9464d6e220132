Ngobese’s remit as IAB SA executive director will involve representing imperative agency requirements on the board, including digital agency and services definitions, as well as using her passion for both digital transformation and transformation through education and the current structures in places to support the transformation journey in our industry.“Over the past decade the industry has experienced a digital evolution, where the tension between logic and magic (data and creativity) has been, and continues to be, a raging debate. For me, there is an opportunity to embrace the fact that both sides of the coin can coexist and that there is a place for both data and creativity in the communications space. Once that state of equilibrium has been achieved, I believe we will be aligned on developing creative work that grows our people, our clients and, ultimately, our country,” comments Ngobese.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/614903.png" alt="3 industry trailblazers join IAB SA executive board" width="400" height="282">Zunaid Parker: IAB SA trust and accountability director; executive head, digital media: advertising at VodacomZunaid Parker has vast experience across multiple organisations, with extensive technical, operational, and strategic business knowledge, specifically focused on growing market share, revenue and new business development.

He currently serves as the executive head of Vodacom digital media advertising (newly branded: VodaMedia).When asked on where he sees the biggest change happening in the industry, Parker comments: “There is no single change element – we are being confronted to act on many areas simultaneously and we yet to reach the inflection point where fundamental changes to decades of tradition will be experienced in both B2C and B2B (swiftly). This is what we need to rally around and understand how to prepare accordingly.”Parker’s remit as trust and accountability director will include leading and localising the IAB transparency and consent framework and IAB gold standard as a global cross-industry effort to help publishers, technology vendors, agencies and advertisers to meet the transparency and user-choice requirements within PoPIA.“Being part of the delivery mandate as critical as the IAB’s purpose validates the opportunity and ‘excitement’.
