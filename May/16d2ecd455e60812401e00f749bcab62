Recently, the team headed back to Africa’s Toughest Tour, Tour du Rwanda. The team, led by Kent Main, placed 10th in the General Classification and 2nd in the Best African Rider and U23 Callum Orniston finished 10th in the Best Young Rider Classification. The team finished off with two Top 10 Stages, eight Top 20 and 13 Top 25 Stages alongside top European-based riders from Israel Start-up nation, Total Direct Energie, B&B Hotels and Androni Giocattoli teams. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/612087.png" alt="DotModus announces sponsorship of ProTouch Pro Cycling team" width="950" height="760">Earlier this year, three of ProTouch’s riders - Kent Main, Rohan du Plooy and Gustav Basson - were selected to represent Team South African at the 15th CAC African Road Championships in Egypt. Impressively, Main brought home a silver medal for the Individual Time Trial and 4th place in the Road Race. The ProTouch Trio’s role was to support World Tour rider Ryan Gibbons to win and, this was achieved successfully, Gustav and Kent also formed part of the team that seized the gold medal in the Team Time Trial.  ProTouch continues to dominate the local racing scene having recently finished the Tshwane Classic in 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th place, following last months’ 1st and 2nd in the Sleepy River Classic. The Team plans to race in Europe next month with a range of upcoming races on the calendar. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/612088.jpg" alt="DotModus announces sponsorship of ProTouch Pro Cycling team" width="950" height="633">About DotModusDotModus is a technology firm focused on business transformation through cloud computing, data analytics and machine learning.
