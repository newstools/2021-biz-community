Firstly, how did you respond to the news of the postponement and how do you feel about judging two-years’ worth of work?I think the postponement was a difficult moment for everybody in the industry, but one that I feel was necessary. The world no longer works in ways we are used to, and many awards festivals had to be sensitive to that. However, I am glad that no one is losing an opportunity to showcase their work..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Share a few of your favourite Cannes Lions-related moments over the years – either from attending personally or agency winning work-related.I attended the Festival in 2012, which feels like a lifetime ago.
