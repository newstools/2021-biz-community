The network also aims to address the growing issue of youth unemployment by training young people to become media facilitators, equipping them with a mobile, solar cinema kit called The Sunbox. The Sunbox allows these media facilitators to screen films in their communities, sparking conversations and enriching the lives of citizens through art, while promoting active citizenship.The debut event, hosted in partnership with the National Film and Video Foundation, saw two movies screened - Liyana and The Letter Reader - and was a fully-booked success, pathing the way for future screenings.Says Zakithi Buthelezi, operations director at Sunshine Cinema: “In preparation for this event, we were seeking assistance from relevant contractors, who wanted to contribute positively to strengthening the fabric of broken societies and communities. “As a renowned media owner, we decided to approach Tractor Outdoor to see if they could assist, and they responded instantly and said that they wanted to support our project.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/608376.jpg" alt="Photo credit: Mik Motala Photography" width="950" height="633">Photo credit: Mik Motala PhotographyLeveraging its supplier network, Tractor built a sturdy screen to display the two films, at no cost.“Through this partnership, we were able to show that public participation is at the heart of what we do, and this will help us expand our reach in the communities that need upliftment the most.”This partnership with Sunshine Cinema is another initiative from Tractor Outdoor that aims to help the broader community, and also dovetails with the media owner’s recently launched #20in2021 SME Initiative. #20in21 pledges to assist businesses hardest hit by the pandemic through a much-needed marketing boost, helping them to increase sales and secure top of mind awareness.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/604904.png" alt="Calling all SMEs: Outdoor media owner to give local businesses advertising boost to the tune of R8m" width="120" height="120">Calling all SMEs: Outdoor media owner to give local businesses advertising boost to the tune of R8mSubmissions are now open for Tractor Outdoor's #20in21 SME Initiative...Issued by Tractor Outdoor 13 Apr 2021Says Simon Wall, CEO at Tractor: “For any business to succeed, the community in which it calls home needs to thrive.
