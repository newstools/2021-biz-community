Every organisation needs to adapt and evolve in order to remain competitive, especially in today’s business environment… and you’d be right. Businesses do need to adapt and evolve to their market and circumstances to increase efficiency and remain competitive. However, there is a difference between digitally transforming with a purpose and without one.This is why you shouldn’t start from how to achieve it – you start from having to prove you need digital transformation in the first place.Digital transformation without purposeThere are hundreds of examples of companies that understand the need to digitally transform. They’re eager to remain competitive and rush out to spend their budgets on new tools and technology, hoping for results that never come. When executives ask why, they hear sheepish answers that point to more technology, different solutions or better tools. The excuses that are generated can even state that the data is wrong, or that the executives should just be patient for the results.Except – the results never come.What went wrong?Above is a typical example of an organisation that attempted to digitally transform without a specific purpose in mind. Sure, there were promises of ‘quality customer experiences’, ‘greater insights’, and ‘more productivity – but these are just statements. They are not specific objectives or goals that fulfil a real purpose.We see it time and time again. Leadership tends to pour more money into digital initiatives and hopes for the best, believing if enough resources are dedicated to the task it will be done well. This continues until the spending reaches critical mass, and everyone realises that the efforts only left them with bills, misused technology and a lot of questions.Unfortunately, you can’t put out a fire by pouring money onto it. This is why, despite the hype, the track record for companies going digitizing is not impressive. The bitter truth is that a shocking 84% of efforts to digitize fail and, according to a Snap Logic research report, 69% of companies need to reevaluate their strategies to digitise.Digital transformation is not cheap, and so it is critical that companies get it right and for the right reasons. To do that, organisations need to specify a purpose for their transformation. Only by identifying a specific purpose with achievable objectives can organisations see if their digital transformation is working or if it needs refinement.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/613506.jpg" alt="You don't need digital transformation" width="950" height="534">Digitally transforming with purposeConsider this – there are thousands of different tools on the marketplace and new technology is coming out every day. Each of those tools and technologies represents a path for your business to take. Like with any journey, some of those paths take you closer to your goal, while others pull you away from your destination.Digitally transforming with purpose is finding that destination where you would like to end up. The challenge, of course, is identifying which destination is beneficial to your business.Identifying your purpose for transformationThe best way to find the purpose for transformation is to set specific objectives and goals for your organisation. You can then use the reason for these to match up with your purpose. The catch is, they need to be specific.Every company wants to ‘increase profits’, ‘boost productivity’ and ‘enhance their customer experience’, but these aren’t specific objectives, they’re wishes. To turn these wishes into objectives, you need metrics and benchmarks to know when you have achieved these objectives.For example, the wish “I want to increase profits” can be turned into an objective by rephrasing it with specifics such as “I want to increase sales by 30%” or “I want to increase profits by cutting down on resource waste by 50%”.Once you have a purpose in mind, you need to know where to implement the transformation within your organisation. This will help you identify the right tool and digital assets you will need. When it comes to digital transformation, there are generally four primary areas where digital tools can assist, depending on your focus and identified objective.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/613507.jpg" alt="You don't need digital transformation" width="950" height="534">4 areas to digitally transformTransformation objectives are typically derived from business objectives and aim at their delivery improvement.
