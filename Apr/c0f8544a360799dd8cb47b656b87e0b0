<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/606323.jpg" alt="The One Club's Right the Ratio 2021 Summit to advance industry gender equity" width="625" height="417">The three-day virtual summit, this year under the banner “Building an Equitable Workplace”, is aimed at decision makers with the authority to advance workplace equality and foster a better, more gender-inclusive environment at their agencies.  Right the Ratio will serve as a forum to share ideas, insights, real-world experiences and solutions that can then be acted upon through all levels of an agency. The summit will help agency leaders make the necessary adjustments and about-faces that will lead to a more equitable workplace.  In an industry where they occupy the majority of leadership roles, men are especially encouraged to attend.A sampling of this year’s Right the Ratio sessions and speakers includes:“Standing Up to Fight the Shecession" Jennifer Blakeslee-DaSilva, CEO, Berlin CameronRonnie Felder, Global Chief People Officer, VMLY&RCourtney Oliver, VP, Human Resources, ViacomDaisy Auger-Dominguez, Chief People Officer, VICESonali Goel, Director, Talent & Development, Macmillan“(R)Aging in The Night” Rene Huey-Lipton, SVP, Qualitative Insights, Maru/Matchbox Yoonjung Crosby, SVP, Chief Talent Officer, FCB GlobalMelody Henderson, Freelance Creative Director, Founder, CURLFESTWalter Geer, ECD, Experience Design, VMLY&R“How to be Meaningful Allies in Recruiting”Hillary Black, VP, Global Executive Recruitment & Leadership Development, WPPTyler Deboard, Associate Director, Talent Acquisition, GSD&MKim Easley, Principal Recruiter, AirbnbEmily Elyshevitz, Creative Manager, Ogilvy“Parents & Burnout: How Companies Should Care for Working Parents”Tiara Puglisi, Director of Marketing, EA Henry Fernandez, Director of Business Evolution, MUH-TAY-ZIK / HOF-FERMary Johnstone, Associate Partner, Head of Talent, Venables Bell + PartnersNeisha Tweed Bell, Head of Health Creative, Creative Shop, Facebook“Real Talk on Building and Supporting the Next Generation of Leaders”Cathy Butler, CEO, OrganicJean Freeman, Principal + CEO, ZambeziHallie Harris, CEO, Village MarketingJason Rosario, Chief Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Officer, BBDO Worldwide“The Importance of Representation for People of All Gender Identities”Nina Kossoff, Director of Community and Marketing, FOLX HealthChris Bergeron, VP Content Experience, CossetteBlake Desormeaux, Director of Strategy, Digitas HealthWinter Mendelson, Founder, Posture MediaThe complete list of speakers can be found here.

Right the Ratio will stimulate dialogue among agency leaders and help make that change happen.”
