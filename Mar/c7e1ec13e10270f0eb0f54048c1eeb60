As a result, an overwhelming 86% of senior marketers believe lack of leadership depth and capabilities has resulted in missed revenue, growth and customer acquisition opportunities. Underscoring the problem, a surprising one third of senior marketers surveyed by the CMO Council in early 2021 admit lack of resources, capabilities and effective leadership in key functional areas “consistently” impair performance of their team; over half concede this is an “intermittent” problem.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2102/598347.jpg" alt="Report reveals insights on how to define, measure and track customer lifetime value" width="120" height="120">Report reveals insights on how to define, measure and track customer lifetime valueA new report from the CMO Council provides insight on how to define, measure and track customer lifetime value for strategic growth and profitability...2 Mar 2021A large number of CMOs (43%) admit that it is “very difficult, time consuming and always challenging” to find experienced, proficient and knowledgeable functional leaders and direct reports; a further 40 percent acknowledge that it is “moderately difficult.” “Most senior marketers say they are challenged by the time it takes to properly recruit and onboard senior functional leaders on their team,” notes Donovan Neale-May, executive director of the CMO Council, which is based in Silicon Valley.  According to Neale-May, more than half of survey respondents say the process takes three to six months and another 15% indicate this can take more than six months. “There’s no doubt the office of the CMO could be quickly and effectively fortified with fractional or interim marketing leaders hired on-demand,” he adds. Findings from the latest CMO Council survey, reveal an overwhelming 93% of chief marketers say they have had a “very positive, quite good or favorable” experience using interim marketing leaders. Not one reported a “poor” relationship and only five percent stated it was inconsistent.  While respondents say sourcing permanent employee talent is complex and time-consuming, only about a third of chief marketers have retained experienced contractors or part time staff at the director and above level. Despite leadership gaps and holes, a surprising 41% of chief marketers report they have not used contractors, while 25% say they are assessing this option or plan to do so in 2021. Scaling the Value of the CMO research highlighted the five main benefits of using fractional or interim marketing leaders.
