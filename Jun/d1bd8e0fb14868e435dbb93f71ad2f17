She has been inducted into the American Advertising Federation’s Hall of Achievement. When she speaks, the industry listens. Her strong moral compass drives her quest to infuse the industry with diversity. As the first female chairperson of The One Club for Creativity, Credle champions up-and-coming creative talent and advocates for industry inclusion of all individuals. She’s also helped to create rigorous and exciting professional development opportunities for all creative professionals. Her belief is that the more varied the industry, the stronger and better off it will be. Over the years, she has done consistent award-winning work for big name clients such as Visa, Gillette, PepsiCo and Bank of America. She’s turned small, challenger brands into category leaders... and even helped to reinvent the iconic M&M characters. As CCO of Leo Burnett USA, she spearheaded a creative renaissance, producing some of the agency’s most memorable work, thanks to her nurturing, collaborative approach. She moved onto FCB in 2016, rocking the boat, but reigniting the network by pushing for better work and coaching her teams towards exceptional results. Her hard work paid off. In 2019, FCB had its best performance ever and was named a top-three Global Network at Cannes – just one of the numerous awards the agency won that year. Susan’s half hour presentation will be followed by a live Q&A session out of New York. This will be hosted by founding partner and group chief creative officer of Joe Public United, Pepe Marais. “Get your popcorn ready to watch the marketing blockbuster of the year from your own screen wherever you are,” says Dale Hefer, Nedbank IMC CEO.
