Many stores are within close proximity of our loyal customers, allowing us to drive down delivery times and costs. Customers now demand an offering that allows them to buy what they want, how they want, when they want and where they want. This strategy implemented over the last few years is positioned to offer customers an always-on ‘one-stop-shop’. Owning the last mile experience enables TFG to improve the customer experience and enhance brand loyalty. This ensures greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Providing the customer with better product selection drives sales growth, higher conversion rates and increased basket sizes. As trust is earned over time, the frequency of visits and spend per customer increases. The click and collect function has evolved into a significant strategic advantage that positions the retailer to provide superior customer service and experience, enabling every store to become an easily accessible collection point for customers. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2010/581640-120x120.jpg?2" alt="How TFG is weaving digital into the fabric of its business" width="120" height="120">How TFG is weaving digital into the fabric of its businessTFG is realising the positive impact of a clearly defined digital strategy and R500m investment into its digital transformation...22 Oct 2020A revolution realised  TFG continues to reap the positive impact of a clearly defined digital strategy and is ready to revolutionise the company for the next season of growth.
