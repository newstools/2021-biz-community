News presenter Moloi is a passionate broadcaster from the Eastern Cape whose love for news and current affairs saw her work in various newsrooms around the country. Zondo got her start in the industry on community TV, followed by her win of the 2013 National SABC Sports Presenter Search, which led her to work on SA FM’s weekend breakfast show for the past few years. Van Eeden also has community radio experience gained while co-hosting a breakfast show on a campus radio station in Stellenbosch. On his gig as breakfast show presenter, Corder says, “5FM has always been the coolest radio station in my world. It is the station of the future where, together with our loyal 5FM fans across the country, I can make the radio of my dreams.” Stephanie B will hold the fort of mid-mornings (Mon – Fri: 9am-12pm) while Zanele Potelwa takes over the afternoon slot (Mon – Fri: 12pm – 3pm). Potelwa joined 5FM as a member of the 5Squad before reading traffic on the breakfast show for the past year. An accomplished presenter for both television and radio, she is known for her effervescent personality and is sure to bring something special with her own weekday show.
