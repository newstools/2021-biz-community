Once again, the aim of the award is to recognise an agency’s credentials set – written credentials document as well as the agency culture reel – within the various agency discipline types e.g. creative, digital, PR, media and design in South Africa.According to Johanna McDowell, the CEO of IAS: “This award will only be judged by marketers and not other agencies or journalists. We want to put agency credentials in front of as many marketers as we can in order to create opportunities for those agencies.” The IAS will also ensure that at least two international intermediaries as well as the IAS directors are part of the judging panel for this award. In addition, this year, entries will be encouraged from agencies in the rest of Africa and the Middle East. “We look forward to working with the Assegai Awards as their sphere of influence increases into the African continent. This coincides perfectly with the IAS’s expansion into other parts of Africa,” concludes McDowell. Closing date for entries is 27 August. The IAS Agency Credentials Award falls into Section F.
