Not only a first for Africa, but a global first within our group, accelerating the candidates' career paths which in turn fuelled growth and profits across our region. Dentsu Africa brought together 26 global experts, who shared expertise in their field. The greatest minds globally equipped our Supersuits on how to build superior client relationships in order for them to revolutionise how we work with clients. Exposure to one-on-one time with the speakers and the opportunities to network and create connections that would elevate their career trajectory.In less than 18 months, the dentsu Supersuits have not only grown and excelled in their career paths but have added immense value to the dentsu business which has created momentum in new business development resulting in over 300% ROI regionally.“With a newfound understanding of the depth and breadth of expertise within our business; it enabled me to expand my capacity and capabilities around client-solutioning. They say that knowledge is power and with the right knowledge, a new accessibility to every part of the dentsu business, the will to achieve the 'never-been-done-before and the support of a global and regional network of talented individuals - I was truly able to 'Dream Loud'.”Quote by, Clare Trafankowska, who was part of the first Supersuits cohort in 2019 at the time she was the Head of Digital for Carat and dentsu x and promoted to Managing Director of iProspect South Africa in 2020.Master Data Consultant ProgramAs the marketing and communication world moves towards becoming data driven to meet the growing customer expectations, Dentsu Data Labs (DDL) and our Customer Experience experts across our network are invested in ensuring our people and clients are set up for success.

A trailblazer is a pioneer that points the way, takes the risks, and changes the ways of thinking. They have a vision for a different future, a faith that turns their dreams into reality, and determination that cuts through barriers and obstacles. After a stringent application process, we were proud to have 18 of our employees selected from across dentsu Africa.Throughout the trailblazer experience, our ambition was for them to feel part of something more, where their experience will be driven by true business and personal development closely linked to our Media LOB strategy. Being part of a community with fellow Trailblazers from across the globe allows for growth, contribution, and development for everyone. At the centre of the programme is a deep focus on where each trailblazer can make a difference to our business and ultimately, to our clients.
