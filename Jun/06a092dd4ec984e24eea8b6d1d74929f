Starring double Oscar®-nominee Cynthia Erivo (Harriet, The Color Purple) in the title role, Genius: Aretha, will start with a special double episode event across the continent, with one episode per week thereafter. Additionally, each episode will be available on DSTV CatchUp after the linear broadcast. Genius is National Geographic’s critically-acclaimed anthology series that dramatises the fascinating stories of the world’s most brilliant innovators and their extraordinary achievements with their volatile, passionate and complex personal relationships. This third season will explore Aretha Franklin’s musical genius and incomparable career, as well as the immeasurable impact and lasting influence she has had on music and culture around the world. Franklin was a gospel prodigy, an outspoken civil rights champion and widely considered the greatest singer of the past 50 years, receiving countless honours throughout her career. Genius: Aretha will be the first-ever, definitive and only authorised scripted series on the life of the universally acclaimed Queen of Soul.Without knowing how to read music, Franklin taught herself to play the piano; at the young age of 12, she began to record songs and sing on gospel tours with her father. She signed her first record deal at age 18 with Columbia Records. In 1966, she moved to Atlantic Records, where she recorded many of her most iconic songs. In 1979, she began a 40-year friendship and partnership with Clive Davis, which produced a number of hit songs, including the highest charting and bestselling song of her career, “I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)”, a duet with George Michael. The legendary singer is one of the world’s best selling musical artists of all time, with more than 75 million records sold globally during her career. Her voice was identified as a “natural resource” by her home state of Michigan.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/613439.jpg" alt="Genius: Aretha; the next instalment in Emmy award-winning anthology series to premiere on Wednesday, 30 June" width="400" height="548">Episodes include:“Respect”Desperate for a hit, Aretha travels to Muscle Shoals in 1967 to record her first album with Atlantic Records.
