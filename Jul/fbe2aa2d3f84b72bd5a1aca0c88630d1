In addition, the startups were offered business advice. The businesses got billboards, TV and radio spots, as well as digital exposure – and the helping hand not only helped them stay afloat, it saw them prosper.Hollard, in the process, positioned itself as one of the good guys and, personally, I wouldn’t mind knowing a company I did business with was doing the right thing.At this time in this country, too, many businesses are, quite venally, gouging both their customers and their own workers, with the pandemic as an excuse.Businesses have to make money, they will tell you. But they also have a moral duty to help improve the lives of everyone, both customers and employees – which, in turn, will uplift a country.So, well done to Hollard for doing the right thing. Orchids to you and to VMLY&R.Stranger than politicsFrom a marketing perspective, I still don’t know what to make of the campaign launched by Herman Mashaba’s Action SA party.As many have pointed out, it seems bizarre that a political party should appeal to voters based on the slogan which asks if you are “Gatvol with politics?”It doesn’t say everyday politics or the normal politics of this country, it just says politics. And that is exactly what you’re going to get from Action SA. Go figure.However, that’s not why they’re getting an Onion.In the party’s zeal to get its posters up everywhere and “paint the town green”, it has been breaking the law.As Democratic Alliance (DA) Johannesburg councillor Leah Knott correctly pointed out, it is illegal to put anything on a street sign. Action SA did this in a number of places, including on stop signs and outside a school.And I’m gatvol of people breaking the law when it comes to advertising – almost as much as I am with politicians (and this includes the DA when they ran Johannesburg, Cllr Knott) not enforcing the law.So, a very green Onion for Action SA.
