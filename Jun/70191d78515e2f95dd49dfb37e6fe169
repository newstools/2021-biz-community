Generation projects will also need to have their registration approved by the regulator to verify that they have met these requirements and to receive authorisation to operate," he said.Municipalities will have discretion to approve grid connection applications in their networks, based on an assessment of the impact on their grid.They will also have to undertake an environmental impact assessment and all other requirements of existing legislation."This will ensure that while we enable as much new generation capacity as possible to come online, we also ensure the orderly development of the energy system."This reform is expected to unlock significant investment in new generation capacity in the short and medium term, enabling companies to build their own generation facilities to supply their energy needs."This in turn will increase the available supply of energy and reduce the burden on Eskom, allowing Eskom to proceed with its intensive maintenance programme and reduce its reliance on expensive gas and diesel turbines," Ramaphosa said.
