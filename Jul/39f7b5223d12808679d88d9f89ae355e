The winning entry illustrates the dramatic real-life sex testing in the 60s, called “nude parades”, that many female athletes went through to prove that they were really women.

A hormone naturally produced by both men and women. They decreased the limits from 10 nmol/L to 5 nmol/L. IAAF Officials had decided that many women no longer qualify as female athletes. And that those girls should be on medication to compete. Sex Testing has had many faces since the 1930s, and it continues to cause psychological damages to girls that just want to run.“We have a great responsibility to drive change. To inspire people. Equality is not inevitable, but a result of a tireless, relentless, and fearless hard work. This award is another step towards a better and equal world we all must fight for.” says Nicholas Bergantin, creative director at Africa.“It's such an honor to be awarded in the very first edition of the SeeHer Lens Award. We really hope this award brings the changes to our society and industry that are needed," celebrates Felipe Luchi, partner at film production company, Santería Filmes
