This figure stood out for me as it signifies that we have a huge task ahead of us in making sure that people fall in love with African brands. We need to interrogate what makes global brands likable in Africa. A beer brand like Guinness for instance is consumed more in Nigeria than in Ireland where it originates. Not to say that there is anything wrong with Africans consuming and admiring foreign brands. But the imbalance is so wide that it cannot be ignored. Brands are entities that represent the image, aspirations and vision of the people who craft them. It is only fair for us to imagine a better world as one where Africans embrace the brands that are created at home. At the end of the day people support brands that they love, and this translates into profit margins and on a larger scale impacts on the economy. The rankings are based on a comprehensive pan-African survey across at least 25 countries spanning all the five economic regions. This accounts for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the continent’s GDP. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/611013-120x120.jpg?1" alt="South Africa's Top 50 most valuable brands for 2021" width="120" height="120">South Africa's Top 50 most valuable brands for 2021The Top 50 most valuable South African brands were initially forecasted to lose over R65bn in cumulative brand value (15%) during the pandemic.

The African Renaissance movement calls upon us to achieve economic, cultural, and scientific renewal. We cannot achieve this, without investing into the local brands in our respective countries. The work is not only cut out for marketing and PR agencies but also for African brands themselves. Some learnings we can take from global companies is that they invest a lot into branding, they aggressively pursue customer connections, and they create impactful experiences for their customers. African brands must do much of the same so that they can gain prominence. There is nothing stopping South African brands the likes of Bathu or Drip for instance from kicking American sports and fitness giant, Nike from the number one spot on the list. Nike has secured the number one spot on that list for the past four years. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/609745-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Media planning: How brands and agencies should strategise during the pandemic" width="120" height="120">Media planning: How brands and agencies should strategise during the pandemicWith the possible third wave emerging in South Africa, brands and agencies need to be reminded that media planning during a pandemic must be curated with continued consideration for people's health and safety...Issued by MegaVision Media 17 May 2021There is also room for others to join African brands like MTN and Dangote to be amongst the 100 most admired brands on the continent.
