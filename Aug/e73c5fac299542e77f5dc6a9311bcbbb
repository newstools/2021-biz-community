They were commissioned to reflect on this year’s Awards theme RISE in the creation of the unique pieces. Together the trophies form a theme that reflects on creative adaptation. Using the base elements of earth or soil, and introducing facets such as spikes and curves, the pieces tell a tale of resilience in a time of challenge, deflecting the negative and leading through creativity.  The BASA Awards colour palette of vibrant purple and pink was infused with earthy and elemental tones of magenta, lilac, gold, yellow and red and the pieces suggest an upward trajectory or ascendency, in keeping with the spirit of the 2020 winners whose partnerships catalysed them into adapting and stretching their skills to create mid-pandemic projects with impact. "Difficult times are not meant to destroy us but to strengthen us. We all have unsuspected reserves of strength inside that emerges during tough times and with that we shall rise and heal and overcome" - Zizipho Phoswa, Imiso CeramicsSays BASA CEO, Ashraf Johaardien, "The exceptional pieces created by Zizipho and Andile truly capture the core of this year's theme. Through their rich textures and vivid colouring, this series of limited edition works embody a call to rise above the great disruption we have all experienced. Importantly the works, created in pairs to be presented to the winning partners, are also a joyous celebration of resilience."The long-time partner of the BASA Awards, Hollard, are proud advocates for the South African arts and an active supporter of cross-sector collaboration between creatives and businesses.The finalists for the 24th BASA Awards have been announced and the countdown has begun to the ceremony which will be virtual again this year and open to all to experience through the https://basa.co.za portal from 30 August 2021.
