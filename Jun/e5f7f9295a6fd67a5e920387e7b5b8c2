Harris says that Tractor also has another 14 RSD sites earmarked for Cape Town, and it plans on adding more sites to its network across various other provinces over the coming months, as well as pivotal arterial routes which it has not previously covered.  The media owner has also just concluded signage rights with Sasol Forecourts, expanding its nationwide outdoor footprint through an additional 100 digital screens. This move will take the media owner’s total digital inventory count to 222 screens, meaning that advertisers can now also benefit from having access to the largest digital network in South Africa. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/613032.jpg" alt="Growth on the agenda: Tractor expands DOOH network with Sasol partnership" width="120" height="120">Growth on the agenda: Tractor expands DOOH network with Sasol partnershipTractor Outdoor has just concluded signage rights with Sasol Forecourts, expanding its nationwide outdoor footprint through an additional 100 digital screens...Issued by Tractor Outdoor 4 Jun 2021Harris acknowledges his colleague and general manager Michael Brits, who he says has played an instrumental role in growing the RSD network. “Mike, who has been with Tractor for over a decade, has a thorough understanding of the signage bylaws, and an astute ability to spot exciting new opportunities. “We’re excited to be in a position to grow our footprint in order to increase our capacity, which, in turn, also demonstrates a recovery in our advertisers’ industries – and an encouraging resumption of economic activity.” About Tractor Outdoor: Established almost two decades ago, Tractor Outdoor is a national out of home (OOH) media owner, which specialises in connecting brands to consumers through its network of traditional and digital inventory, as well as its transit networks and ambient platforms.
