Why go virtual? An online format means relatively low costs for exhibitors who save on travel, stand setup and consumables, and combine that cost-saving benefit with access to a national audience, measurable event performance data and lead generation, translating into greater return on investment for brands. And the best part is that brands and their offerings are listed beyond the two days, for 365 days thereafter at no additional charge.But the BabyYumYum Virtual Parenting Experience is not simply a parenting tradeshow, it is an opportunity for retail brands to equip parents and caregivers with the information and products they need to make raising their children an easier and more rewarding experience, while also saving them time and money. The virtual approach benefits delegates too. There are clear time- and money-saving advantages for those who don’t need to travel to a physical expo, plus they can still ‘visit’ exhibitors, ‘attend’ workshops and talks, interact with retailers and network with other attendees – all from the convenience of their home.
