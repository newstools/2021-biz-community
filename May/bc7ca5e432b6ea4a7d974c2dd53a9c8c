What’s so amazing about this documentary is you’re in a place where no competition exists because there is space for anyone willing to contribute to the African Restoration Movement. The documentary film made us realize just how precious Africa’s landscapes are. It refuels us to do more” said Mamadou Diakhite: Acting Head of Environmental Sustainability at AFR100. “This is only the beginning. We at Justdiggit believe that the true power of regreening lies in powerful storytelling which brings people and organisations to join forces to reverse climate change. By combining simple techniques, strong communication and mobile technology is where the magic of regreening happens. By applying this approach, we can potentially scale beyond sub-Sharan Africa within the coming 10 years” says Wessel van Eeden, Global Marketing Director at Justdiggit. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/610984.jpg" alt="The Grand African Green Up to premiere on National Geographic this World Environment Day weekend" width="950" height="534">“The Grand African Green Up is a perfect complement to Planet Possible’s call to action, and we hope that this television event will not only enlighten our viewers, but also inspire them in their own personal discovery of ways they can help make a difference,” says Evert van der Veer, Vice President, Media Networks, The Walt Disney Company Africa. “The film is authentically African, celebrating incredible work being done on the continent and is a wonderful showcase and message, exquisitely told and thoughtfully produced.” Launched in April on Earth Day, Planet Possible is National Geographic’s new multi-platform, multi-year initiative aimed at empowering people to live more lightly on the planet.
