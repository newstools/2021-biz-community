I get down and dirty to understand the cultural nuances of the youth and distil them back into the brand. As one of the driver’s behind this brand, I’m here to be at our consumer’s service. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Growing up, what did you want to be?Initially a veterinarian, I loved animals from such a young age and that coupled with being a natural empath. I just wanted to care for all the furry friends in my life. Later, I’d hoped I could travel and get paid for it, but the bills started coming in and being a person with a wealth of connections between my two brain spheres balancing the creative and the commercial, marketing ignited a passion in fulfilling a career path for me..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us about your career: what you studied and why, and how you ended up where you are today?I studied at The University of Cape Town where I did my BA in Film, Media English & Web Design. I met a woman called Lauren Wolf who told me that since getting into advertising she was so fulfilled that she felt like she’d never worked a day in her life. Our conversations really piqued my interest in marketing. I then did my Post Graduate Specialising in Marketing, and I’ve just been having so much fun on my journey. I interned at Distell for the whisky's portfolio. I then got promoted to international marketing co-ordinator, focussing on international wine business and got to travel outside the continent selling my favourite drinks. After that fun year, I became the activation brand manager for Bernini, where my team and I brought the brand back from the bottom shelf and turned it to an affordable luxury for the ladies.
