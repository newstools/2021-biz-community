The products are made using Jameson whiskey, barley (which is beneficial for skin and hair) and "other quality skin ingredients", Jameson says in a statement.Getting the brand in the hands of consumersAccording to the 243-year-old premium whiskey brand, the move into beauty comes at a time when the liquor industry has been faced with many challenges on how it can reinvent itself in the midst of uncertainty. Jameson says it has acknowledged the call for the industry to pivot and sees this as "a major game-changer" that it anticipates consumers will be excited about.“We are incredibly proud of our new Beatha offering which we believe will expand our territory in such a profound manner. Not only is the beauty space one that is ever commercially thriving through demand, it also contributes meaningfully to consumers' lives which is what we are about as a brand,” says Beatrice Marfleet, marketing manager of Jameson and Irish Whiskeys.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/602700-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Acquisition of Avroy Shlain brings beauty company back to SA" width="120" height="120">Acquisition of Avroy Shlain brings beauty company back to SATrinitas Equity Partners, together with its partners, has acquired the South African beauty company, Avroy Shlain...2 days agoMarfleet adds, “Jameson is also a brand that has a strong base with women and this offering would not only reach them but would ensure that should there ever come a time the industry needed to shut down again, we would always be able to get our brand in the hands of the consumer."Skin trioThe Beatha range includes a Restorative Facial Mousse, a Hydrating Facial Oil and a Beard Oil.
