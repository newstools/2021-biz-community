Cava Sneakers was then born, through the combination of our digital marketing skills and love for unique fashion,” explains Lebogang Mokubela, Cava Sneakers’ chief marketing officer.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/610683.jpg" alt="Cava Sneakers launched during lockdown by husband and wife team" width="600" height="351">The word 'Cava' is township slang meaning "to look or to see". According to the founders, Cava Sneakers is on a mission to provide footwear "you will not find in any retail outlet – it is about exclusivity that does not cost an arm and a leg".Naledi Mokubela, chief operations officer, explains, “We have partnered with independent sneaker designers from different countries to bring people exclusive sneakers that will make people stop and cava. Our brand is for those that do not want to look like everyone else – it is a brand for those that seek out opportunities to be and look different.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/610684.jpg" alt="Cava Sneakers launched during lockdown by husband and wife team" width="600" height="426">Promising growthSince its launch in June 2020, Cava Sneakers has seen attracted over 40,000 followers on social media and sold over 1,000 pairs, some of them to customers as far afield as Belgium and the Unites States. Four jobs have also been created.Sneakers are sold on a pre-order basis where customers place their orders on the Cava Sneakers online store or via Whatsapp, and order are delivered to their doors within two to four weeks. “The business has grown really well, despite our two to four week waiting period. This is a testament that South Africans (and people from different parts of the world) believe in what Cava stands for. "The growth, however, also came with teething issues. We have been struggling with a backlog of orders that have led to a rise in customer complaints in recent months. This is something that we are not proud of; we are certainly working hard at alleviating the backlog and ensuring that, going forward, we do not have such issues,” says Lebogang.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/601178.jpg" alt="South Africa's newest sportswear brand gives a different meaning to sports apparel" width="120" height="120">South Africa's newest sportswear brand gives a different meaning to sports apparelSMMEs have a vital role to play in the creation of jobs, especially in targeting the rampant youth unemployment rate.
