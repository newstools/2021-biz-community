Focus on SEOSearch Engine Optimisation (SEO) is the method used to increase the quality and the quantity of your website traffic and the exposure your brand gets through non – paid (also known as 'organic') search engine results. Paid advertising, social media and various other online platforms can be a great way to generate online traffic. Nevertheless, its majority is created through search engines. Organic search results account for most of the digital space. They appear more credible to smart searchers and receive significantly more clicks than paid advertisements. SEO is also a good tool for evergreen content (SEO content that stays relevant and valuable for a long time). If the content is relevant and lasts years into the future, it can continue to yield a return on investment over a long time. Creating a good piece of content that ranks well because of its keywords allows good traffic to snowball over time. Advertising, though effective, is less sustainable and requires continuous funding to send traffic to your site. The business world is rapidly changing. Businesses now understand that they need to do the same. The business environment has changed in the past year. Businesses have had to adapt to the unforgiving environment or pay the price. We must employ a variety of tools to reach, engage and sell to our customers. The inevitable tidal wave of change is finally here. The question is: will you sink or swim?
