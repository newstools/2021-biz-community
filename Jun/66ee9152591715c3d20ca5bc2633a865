She’s a recipient of several international accolades as well as the co-author of children’s book Melo’s Kingdom. Professor Madonsela knows that, win or lose, platforms such as Women of the Future are valuable to entrepreneurs.She believes that to be an entrepreneur, you need an idea, passion and the ability to work hard. "I am looking for women who are building a world they want to live in," says Professor Madonsela. "They also need to be looking to the future, and the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution."Doreen MorrisTelevision producer, presenter, broadcasting veteran and entrepreneur, Doreen Morris brings a unique and experienced perspective to the panel. She understands the importance of a vote of confidence."It is very important for women to support other women in business and beyond – that has certainly been my experience in my own career," she says.Morris believes that the representation of women in South African business spheres is imperative. "I began my career at a time when diversity was not a priority; now, it has become so important to pay attention to the advancement and support of female entrepreneurs. I will be taking note of women who have found innovative ways to respond to pressing needs in society, whose impact is far-reaching, and who find time to empower and mentor other women."Dawn Nathan-JonesSocial entrepreneur, professional speaker and fourth-time judge, Dawn Nathan-Jones believes this competition is the perfect platform to give the women of South Africa opportunities, recognition and encouragement."Many entrepreneurs used the pandemic as a catalyst and opportunity to transform their businesses from the present to the new future," she says."Entrepreneurs are optimistic by nature and build nimble businesses to adapt quickly to change; they are also constantly looking for new ideas. This innovation is what will help alleviate the unemployment crisis we face. I am looking for businesswomen who have demonstrated adaptability in the face of fragility, hope in times of fear and resilience over adversity. I will take note of women who are forward-thinking and who have been able to successfully lead people through times of uncertainty."Enid LizamoreEnid Lizamore, executive head of Human Resources at Santam, offers insight into the world of transformation and what entrepreneurial support can look like across various industries. She believes female entrepreneurs will play a significant role in the future of South Africa’s economy, and encourages entrepreneurs to never lose sight of their business goals, more so during these trying economic times."I am passionate about seeing women lead and drive change and have thus made it my responsibility to try to pave a pathway of opportunities for them," she says. "I am looking for courageous women who display tenacity, a hunger to empower others, and a willingness to build a bigger, brighter South Africa." Suzy BrokenshaFairlady editor Suzy Brokensha is a veteran in the magazine publishing industry. She believes that women can make a crucial difference to South Africa’s fragile economy."South African women are real entrepreneurs in the sense that they are resilient free-thinkers," says Suzy. "When your electricity is being cut off regularly, or you can’t rely on public transport or other public services, you need to be able to think on your feet. That toughness and make-a-plan attitude stood us in good stead during the pandemic, and I think many of the businesses that survived the past two years are really going to fly now. I am looking for a business that has managed to thrive despite difficult circumstances, because I know the woman behind it will be a powerhouse."Makhosazana ‘Khosi’ Zwane-SiguqaTrueLove editor Makhosazana ‘Khosi’ Zwane-Siguqa is a multi-award-winning journalist and editor.
