<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2108/623407.png?5" alt="Newspapers ABC Q2 2021: Green shoots for newspapers" width="625" height="325">The Bureau cites 2020 as the print industry’s “annus horribilis” having to content with massive lockdowns that led to “plummeting circulations, drastic reductions in advertising budgets and the sad closure of many of South Africa's favourite titles”. It praised the industry for being able to “pivot, adjust, and make some significant changes to stay around” and says these moves are paying off. "Every year, the doomsayers predict the final demise of print. But this quarter proved once again that the print media owners are an agile bunch. Always willing and looking to change, adapt and evolve to stay relevant to their readers," says Chris Botha, chairperson of the ABC. The latest ABC results show that newspaper circulations are up 1% quarter on quarter and compared to the numbers in Q4 2020 – Newspapers are up 2%.Daily newspapersThe category could not capitalise on its good showing in Q1 and the Dailies that did increase over the previous quarter only showed single figure increases. The best are Business Day and Cape Times, but both only increased by less than five percent. Most of the Dailies showed a deceased on the previous quarter. However, like the increases, many of the decreases were small, except for Daily Sun which saw an almost 10% decrease on the previous quarter.
