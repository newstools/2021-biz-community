This is a culmination of all the behind-the-scenes work, that we have been engaged with over the past few months, to determine how the business will move forward.The lessons from the past year, where every aspect of our lives got affected, are that; it cannot be business as usual and our environment was no exception. So we have been working very hard to ensure that we respond vigorously to the current economic challenges and that our business model is aligned to what the future looks like,” says Zondi.Incoming MD, Dlamini, echoed Zondi’s sentiments. “We are not only realigning our operations, but our imagination of the brand and its future as well. We are shifting the mindset, and all this will be reflected in how we will engage with our audience moving forward.This will be our new normal where we elevate the consumer experience across all brand touch-points. We have already identified our business model as multi-channel based and we have seen much progress from that in both audience interaction and commercial activity, we are now going to build from that going to the future,” says Dlamini.Further announcements in relation to how these changes filter down to the functioning of the station will be made in due course.
