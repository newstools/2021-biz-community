The framework will play a key role in meeting the broadband penetration goals set in the Authority’s Strategic Plan (2018–2023).“We are delighted to see that the TVWS framework will now be used to enable cost-effective broadband deployment to increase digital inclusion across Kenya. More opportunities for digital growth and innovation will now be possible” says Martha Suárez. “Following many years of advocating for TVWS in Kenya, we are thrilled to see the potential of TVWS realised as a catalyst to a digital future.”The TVWS framework allows lightly licensed white space devices to operate at locations where Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) bands are not in use by licensed services, while protecting primary users from receiving harmful interference.As demand rapidly rises for high-quality broadband, this dynamic approach to spectrum sharing will play a vital role in supporting various use cases, including broadband data, Internet of Things (IoT), Super Wi-Fi, emergency communications and community networks.Suárez added, “The provision of lightly licensed white space devices will allow for affordable broadband and internet access to be delivered in unserved and underserved regions of Kenya. This decision is enabling a new digital ecosystem, giving access to spectrum to local Kenyan Internet Service Providers that are making incredible efforts to provide affordable connectivity in rural areas, and especially now during the COVID-19 crisis that connectivity has proven to be an essential service. ”It is thanks to the partnership between the Communications Authority of Kenya and the Strathmore University, @iLab Africa supported by the UK Prosperity Fund Digital Access Programme that the success of the TVWS framework has been brought to Kenya and this seems to be the first step in a very innovative long-term vision about dynamic spectrum management, led by the Authority.
