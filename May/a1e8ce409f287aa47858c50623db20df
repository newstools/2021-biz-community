Little wonder then that leading global brands, from Walmart to Unilever, are all singing the same tune – ‘doing good’ is actually good for business.But what about Africa? Add our verse to the song sheet, because C-19 Barometer* reveals 90% of consumers in Africa also feel it’s important to buy products from brands that support causes they care about. But to get this right, you need to take the time for strategic planning before jumping in with purpose. You’ll need to link your sustainability goals back to your overall brand purpose and ensure this is clearly communicated internally to staff and stakeholders alike before you start putting your messaging before the public.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/602531-120x120.png?2" alt="Boosting brand purpose by solving value-action gaps in Africa" width="120" height="120">Boosting brand purpose by solving value-action gaps in AfricaHow do corporations best articulate and act upon their brand purpose, as the interface between corporations and society? By solving the value-action gap, writes Kantar's Adeola Tejumola...By Adeola Tejumola, Issued by Kantar 25 Mar 2021Building purpose-led brands for real sustainable transformation True sustainable transformation is about more than ticking the CSR tick box. It needs to be truly embedded across the business, so you first need to clearly articulate and understand your brand purpose. Only then can you identify a value-action-gap to close with authenticity, to harness sustainable brand growth. Because business success today is no longer about just profit, but about profit with purpose. Take Unilever as an example:<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/607923.jpg" alt="Doing good is good for business: How brand purpose can steer your sustainability journey in Africa" width="800" height="449" rel="">click to enlargeWe’ve helped guide its sustainable transformation journey for the past decade, and it’s only just getting started with its new inclusive beauty vision that sees a shift away from the word ‘normal’.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/600868-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Unilever adopts new inclusive beauty vision, bans the word 'normal'" width="120" height="120">Unilever adopts new inclusive beauty vision, bans the word 'normal'Unilever will adopt a clearer mission surrounding inclusive beauty standards across all its beauty and personal care brands' products, packaging and advertising...11 Mar 2021But this may have come across as inauthentic if it hadn’t already made a continuous and consistent commitment to building purpose-led brands. Nor would it make sense for a car brand to make the same claim about inclusive beauty. Instead, it’d need to focus on carbon emissions and the manufacturing process. After all, Unilever CEO Alan Jope says it best: “One of the most dangerous mindsets in the world is to set up a false dichotomy between sustainability and economic growth.”​​The intersection of brand purpose, strategy and sustainability After all, we’re living in a world where there’s an accelerated need for brand purpose to be clear and for sustainable action to be first and foremost. Consumers expect businesses to lead the way and help them make sustainable brand choices. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2011/583826-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Gen Z: The generation that is crafting a better Africa" width="120" height="120">Gen Z: The generation that is crafting a better AfricaAre you ready for African Gen Z...By Ndeye Diagne, Issued by Kantar 5 Nov 2020If consumers in Africa only cared about climate change, it would be difficult for brands to create meaningful and creative responses to fill the gap. Take your cue from the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which vary across pillars of profit, like avoiding child labour and worker exploitation; the people pillar, where there’s a need for quality healthy products and safe packaging; as well as the planet pillar of sustainable sourcing.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/607925.jpg" alt="Doing good is good for business: How brand purpose can steer your sustainability journey in Africa" width="800" height="449" rel="">click to enlargeYou can certainly align with more than one SDG, if it feels authentic to consumers in your category and makes sense for your brand. Be sure to not only align your sustainability purpose with consumers’ values but also communicate this clearly and consistently, to avoid being seen as simply ‘jumping on the bandwagon’. The ability to overlay your brand strategy or purpose with wider societal concerns is becoming crucial for brand development and growth. Especially as purpose itself is no longer limited to the functional and emotional delivery of your brand. Increasingly, to be meaningful, brands and businesses need to stand for something that goes beyond category, often informed by the wider social or sustainability lens. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2009/577729.jpg" alt="The evolution of purpose" width="120" height="120">The evolution of purposePurpose is one of the most misunderstood and misused business buzzwords today.

The public keeps a watchful eye on brand behaviour and is quick to comment on social media when they feel something is inconsistent or dishonest.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/607927.jpg" alt="Doing good is good for business: How brand purpose can steer your sustainability journey in Africa" width="800" height="544">So, chat to Astrid Ricketts, Kantar’s client partner leading the foundational study in Africa.
