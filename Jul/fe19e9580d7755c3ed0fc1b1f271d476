The execution was beautifully handled by photographer David Prior with art direction from Seth Beukes and copy by Jayson Dicks and was specifically crafted to show dog lovers how their imaginations are prodding them toward giving some lucky dog a new forever home.For more information about adoption, go to https://www.sandtonspca.org.za/ or https://www.sandtonspca.org.za/adopt-a-pet/
