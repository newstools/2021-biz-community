Submissions have improved and increased year-on-year, with South African corporates, agencies and students producing some truly remarkable work. This is an affirmation that the industry is developing at a much faster pace than in previous years. “Looking through this year’s entries has shown me 'that even through difficult times, South Africans, move forward, get stuck in and conquer," comments New Gen’s founder, Stephen Paxton.Teams have become more technically minded, smarter strategies can be seen across multiple platforms, resulting in clever content and greater reach and engagement, and the results achieved across a number of campaigns has been phenomenal.The New Generation Social & Digital Media Awards announces Supersonic as its 2021 Headline Naming SponsorFor the next 12 months, the awards will be known as 'The Supersonic New Generation Awards'...Issued by Lavello Marketing Solutions 1 day ago“I would like to thank our esteemed judges for all their hard work over the past two weeks marking this year's entries, and to our headline sponsors Supersonic, Gold sponsors Futuretech Media and Bronze sponsors Wunderman Thompson for your invaluable support and to everyone that entered the awards.
