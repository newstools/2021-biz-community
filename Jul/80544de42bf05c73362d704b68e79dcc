This trend will speak loud and proud for years to come as people more strongly speak their truth. We ♥ this trend as it mirrors a move to give all people a voice and particularly those who have stayed silent. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/618155.png" alt="Design trends that 'make it pop'" width="475" height="475"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/618157.png" alt="Design trends that 'make it pop'" width="475" height="475">Designed by NothandoAbstract psychedelic High power psychedelics did not get stuck in the 1970s. This trend has travelled forward in time, though with a bit more finesse, as these unapologetic patterns and colours take on abstract dimensions.
