An innovative new endpoint is now on that list.... Near Me. Launched by Vicinity Media last year, Near Me is a smart microapp that’s easily integrated on any mobile site or app, serving as a ‘mini search engine' for nearby businesses. It streamlines the local search process in a more intuitive way, and has other location-based features, like the most accurate weather available on mobile web. To date, Near Me’s local audience is a cool five million... and growing! The good news? Location Bank clients will now be published on this endpoint: something no other provider of professional digital location management can offer.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/602408.png" alt="Near Me: A new endpoint with millions of local users" width="950" height="651">How does Near Me work?
