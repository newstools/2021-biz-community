Samantha is a highly respected agent and much loved by her actors and peers alike. As Associate Agent, Samantha will work hand-in-hand with the MLA team in Johannesburg to ensure seamless opportunities for its selected roster of multilingual and diverse talent.“This was an opportunity I was not prepared to miss. MLA has a stellar reputation representing some of the best in the business. In these challenging times, innovation and collaboration are key to future success. I am looking forward to being part of the incredibly dynamic and successful MLA team,” says Bernhardi. At the beginning of this year, in a bold move, MLA became an exclusive representation agency, resulting in a situation in which dual representation in different cities within South Africa was no longer an option for the talent pool managed by the agency.Says Nina Morris-Lee, CEO of MLA: “Opening a Cape Town office just makes sense as does having Samantha on the ground representing us. I felt that although single representation is the right way to work, it was compromising our Cape Town actors and restricting our Johannesburg actors from certain briefs that were not reaching us. I believe that all the actors we represent, regardless of where they are located, have to be given the opportunity to audition on all work available. I’m extremely excited about this new chapter in the story of MLA’s success, and look forward to Samantha being part of the team.” MLA Cape Town, in association with Samantha Bernhardi, begins operating on 4 May 2021.For more information go to www.mlasa.com
