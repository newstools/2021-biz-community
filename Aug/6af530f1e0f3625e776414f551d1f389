What have been some of your ultimate career highlights?Being featured on Bizcommunity obviously! Yes, I like to flatter. But I’ve also got all the love in the world for your team because you’ve always supported every venture that I’ve undertaken, whether it’s a failure or a success. One of my recent successes, however, is my number one music podcast Texx Talks, which has become like my proverbial child and every season I watch it grow and grow and it’s a real thing of beauty.I think my recent cover of the Mail & Guardian’s Art section, in light of Texx Talks being something that people like to listen to, is also pretty great.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/542160-120x120.png?2" alt="Texx and the City to launch 'Texx Talks' music podcast in April" width="120" height="120">Texx and the City to launch 'Texx Talks' music podcast in AprilEntertainment website Texx and the City will introduce its music podcast,  Texx Talks, on 9 April 2020.

We had two gin-fuelled ‘meetings’ about it and then before I knew it, I was in the studio and season one was done. I had no idea that we would go into our first lockdown as we launched season one though, so the snowball of its success really caught me by surprise but also provided us with a unique set of challenges as to how to record season two. But with the help of TOMS, we navigated that and even now as we begin the planning of season seven. Through our continued lockdowns, Texx Talks has given me a sense of purpose and renewed creative spirit. Can you tell I’m mildly obsessed with my podcast?.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you attribute your success to?The hard work of everyone involved. It takes a village. But over the years I figured out that my strength as a journalist and an interviewer lies in my ability to connect with my subject when I’m sitting in front of them. Remote recordings obviously presented a bit of a challenge on this front, but I’ve been able to adapt my interviewing style where I’m still engaging enough and ask the right questions to get the goods. I like to make people feel comfortable like they’re having a chat with a good friend.

Men never apologise and it’s time that we claim our voice and our space in every workplace because we deserve to be there as much as they do.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2101/592148-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#BizTrends2021: A renewed focus on community through exclusive content and livestreaming" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2021: A renewed focus on community through exclusive content and livestreamingI'm not one to blow my own trumpet - well, not too much anyway - but all of the #BizTrends that I made last year came to fruition.

There need to be more community-led projects that invest in the future of girls from an early age - whether it be through after school programmes where they can learn various skills or different extracurricular activities where they can hone talents that might not appear automatically in the classroom..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Are there any female figures who have had a particularly positive influence on your life?My answer to this will always be my mother because she taught me how to navigate this life thing and she’s still my go-to for every important decision that I make on a day-to-day basis.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/599146-120x120.jpg?2" alt="4 easy ways to help your friendly neighbourhood musician survive Covid-19" width="120" height="120">4 easy ways to help your friendly neighbourhood musician survive Covid-19Here are a few ways you can put your hard-earned randelas to good use by helping your favourite musicians.By Tecla Ciolfi 1 Mar 2021.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about being a woman?The ability to totally baffle a man..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s your hidden talent?I can fold my tongue into very weird shapes so naturally I’m a hit at all the jols.
