The awards celebrate African women who inspire confidence through rewriting the narrative, leaders who advocate positive change and are committed to economic and social transformation on the continent especially in a Covid recovery phase. These are women who have challenged authority to bring about change and created a new discourse that will enable future generations to live in a better and more equal world.    Last year’s winners included Dr Aisha Pandor, co-founder of SweepSouth; DJ Zinhle; Olajumoke Adenowo, founder of Ad Consulting; Bafana Khumalo, co-founder of Sonke Gender Justice; and Irene Charnley, founder and Deputy Chairman of Smile Telecoms Holdings; among others. “I’d like to congratulate all the 2021 award winners for being such incredible leaders in their respective fields, particularly after such a tumultuous year,” said Renuka Methil, managing editor of Forbes Africa and Forbes Woman Africa. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2102/596331.jpg" alt="2021 Forbes Woman Africa Leading Women Summit to focus on resetting Africa" width="120" height="120">2021 Forbes Woman Africa Leading Women Summit to focus on resetting AfricaThe 6th Forbes Woman Africa Leading Women Summit is set to explore the power of the collective in resetting Africa...8 Feb 2021“This year we adapted to a completely online format, and while we do miss the face-to-face interaction, the digital space gave us the opportunity to expand the #LeadingWomanSummit footprint and reach a much bigger audience. And, with the global pandemic creating so much disruption worldwide, this summit was a welcome opportunity to get insight from these grounded, inspiring women who’ve all given us a renewed sense of hope.” Commenting on the awards, Suzanne Morel, Mastercard Country Manager for South Africa said: “As a proud partner of the Forbes Woman Africa Leading Women Summit, we would like to offer our congratulations to all these inspirational women who have been recognised in this year’s awards. Not only have they made a tremendous impact in their respective fields, but they are leading the charge in opening up the world’s possibilities to women.
