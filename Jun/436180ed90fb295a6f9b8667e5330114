What are some key points you’re thinking of talking to and why?I’m fascinated by our search for authenticity and what research based creativity yields. It always feels like we’re going two steps forward and one step backward. I suppose our market is tricky, but I feel that we often take the consumer for granted, our work could be smarter. We still struggle a lot with trying to satisfy everyone in our communication. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}This will surely help give South Africa’s creative excellence a spotlight on the global stage. Where do you think SA is at creatively speaking in relation to its global counterparts?Currently, the world of ideas is driven by technology and big budgets, and we’re not doing well on both. So sadly on the big integrated campaign space we’re being left behind but on the idea space we’re on par. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/613500.jpg" alt="#CreativeWeek2021: Global Media Talks: Neo Mashigo, CCO at M&amp;C Saatchi Group" width="1200" height="675"> <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/613010.jpg" alt="#CreativeWeek2021: Global Media Talks: Xolisa Dyeshana, CCO at Joe Public United" width="120" height="120">#CreativeWeek2021: Global Media Talks: Xolisa Dyeshana, CCO at Joe Public UnitedA brief exclusive with Xolisa Dyshana in the run-up to his presence as a panellist at next week's One Show "Creative Week 2021 Global Media Talks"...By Evan-Lee Courie 4 Jun 2021.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}This year’s Creative Week theme is ‘connect. provoke. inspire’.
