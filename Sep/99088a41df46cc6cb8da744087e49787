What will Geometry Cape Town be contributing?Correct. The Geometry team will bring extensive experience in regulated industries as well as full marketing mix solutioning. A key part of this will be strengthening the trade offering, as well as bringing in more below-the-line experience, strengthening the existing commerce offering and developing effective business growth drivers. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}I believe 35 team members will be integrating into VMLY&R. What does this mean for the organisational structure of Geometry Cape Town?Essentially it means a bigger team, but the same dream. In terms of the structure, VMLY&R has been growing exponentially over the last year so the additional hands and minds couldn’t have come at a better time for VMLY&R. We are also able to “make the circle bigger” since each of the individuals within the now bigger team holds their own portfolios and responsibilities..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Will VMLY&R be involved in any way with Geometry Cape Town?Geometry Cape Town essentially becomes part of the integrated VMLY&R team. The integration means that together we are re-tooled to service both the current and future needs of consumers. Among other things, this means turning brands into experiences, design into demand, innovation into products and retail into immersion.
