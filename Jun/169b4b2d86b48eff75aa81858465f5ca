The rebrand of the products aims to reflect a look that depicts the sealed-in goodness of our products, bringing our quality promise to life – all the quality, convenience and taste across our range of food products, from canned fruit, veg and legumes, to jams, juice and pickled salads.”Design strategyTo illustrate this, Patel says that the pack refresh consists of a shift in logo colour towards a more natural and vibrant green, a modernised font and an evolution to a fresh, 3D logo. “The on-pack photography highlights the quality ingredients we use in our products while driving the connection to source, and makes use of clever food styling which cues visuals of ‘freshly prepared’ food aimed at demonstrating the appetite appeal of our range.”RFG looked to Startle, its packaging design agency of 16 years, to develop a concept for the whole range based on the company's research insights.“The task was vast, but Startle worked across the categories that we operate in, from fruit to tomatoes, veg, beans and legumes, jams, juice and salad pickles, and found a solution that would tie our brand together across the range, and create distinction and appetite appeal on shelf,” said Patel.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/612275-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Pieter Hanekom to replace Rhodes Food Group CEO of 22 years" width="120" height="120">Pieter Hanekom to replace Rhodes Food Group CEO of 22 yearsBruce Henderson, who has served as CEO of Rhodes Food Group for 22 years, is to retire in September this year and will be succeeded by Pieter Hanekom...31 May 2021Sharon Rushton, creative director and co-owner of Startle, comments, “We were tasked with bringing to life the Rhodes Quality ‘Rooted in Goodness’ new brand positioning with a full packaging review and re-design.
