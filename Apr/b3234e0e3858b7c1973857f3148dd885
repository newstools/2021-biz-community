Simple, we have a vast repository of accoladed marketing and data tools and historic data to benchmark against. This is how we ensure we’re on the right track.The first step is asking the ‘why?’: Why are we doing this and to what end?This way, we set up intelligent positioning and measurement metrics for the strategy.Setting specific, measurable, actionable, relevant and time-sensitive objectives will help you gain a better direction and keep stronger control of your marketing efforts.Doing this allows you to manage and execute according to your outlined KPIs, meaning efforts are not wasted and are intentional. This is the core outcome of a strategy/strategic plan audit on a regular basis. Deciding where to spend your digital marketing budget requires us to consider multiple factors. Taking a social media element of the strategy, for example, you might want to ask:Which social media platform resonates most with your brand voice, style and, of the course, target audience?Is this platform also where your audience is? How does social media align with your business needs or objectives and have you set KPIs for this channel?Competitor review, which social media channels are your competitors in, how can you compete with their presence?Auditing upfront and on a regular basis gives you the ability to make sure everything is aligned to business objectives and goals.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2101/592233-120x120.png?2" alt="UpBeet Digital - The new digital agency with deep industry roots and delicious fruit" width="120" height="120">UpBeet Digital - The new digital agency with deep industry roots and delicious fruitWhether your company is in need of a digital marketing strategy to guide, support, inform and help your teams achieve your goals and objectives, UpBeet Digital has the solution for your brand and your business...Issued by UpBeet Digital 8 Jan 2021UpBeet Digital’s core offerings, being digital marketing and performance auditing - we will continue to deliver week on week a new chapter into the unpacking of digital auditing.
