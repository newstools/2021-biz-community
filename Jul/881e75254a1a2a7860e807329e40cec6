We all have stories to tell,” he says, “stories that inspire, motivate and ignite.”As a gay man, Hiller feels strongly that it is vital to have a safe space to share these stories and experiences. “It is these spaces that allow us not only to build fruitful professional and personal relationships with one another, but to be advocates for all minority or marginalised groups. It is about being able to provide understanding and support. These conversations can spark change,” Hiller asserts.Noting that the ability for an individual to choose where in the world they feel like they really belong – safely – is something Hiller strives for daily, both in his business and personal life.“I have been fortunate enough to have worked in environments that have supported me both personally and professionally,” he says, “so I’ve not really been subjected to the kind of exclusion many others have.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/610676-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Reed Exhibitions Africa inclusion and diversity: Inclusivity that is economic, emotional and empowering" width="120" height="120">Reed Exhibitions Africa inclusion and diversity: Inclusivity that is economic, emotional and empoweringWhen it comes to core principles, Reed Exhibitions Africa is not just an advocate of both inclusion and diversity (I&D) across all its divisions, but an active, results-oriented participant, says Martin Hiller...Issued by RX Africa 21 May 2021“The fact that I haven’t been marginalised means I must take a stand for groups and individuals who have.
