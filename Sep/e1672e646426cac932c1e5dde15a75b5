"Just to have been recognised as one of the top five coolest brands was already an achievement we were really proud of considering the number of competitors in the category we are playing in. To ultimately win Coolest Alcohol Brand has given us the nod from the youth to highlight that we are on the right path with our #SiyavannaSouthAfrica approach. Everything we do is rooted in real consumer insight and taps into the realities of life in South Africa.  Having navigated through the new world we find ourselves in we have stayed true to our commitment to uplift our much loved consumers through tough times.  We did this with unrestricted laughter, proactive harm reduction messaging and lively always on social media activity," said Eugene Lenford, marketing manager at Savanna, Distell.
