Not surprisingly, management in large and smaller enterprises differ in their views of marketing development needs, operational requirements, role and value in their organisations.The findings were based on a 2021 survey fielded by the CMO Council in partnership with the C-Suite Network, Business Performance Innovation (BPI) Network, and a Harvard Business School alumni association. Underwriting for the project came from Chief Outsiders, a leading fractional CMO service provider. Survey participants (120) included a mix of senior management executives across companies of all sizes, industry sectors and diverse leadership roles. Nearly 40% of respondents were in companies of more than $1bn in annual revenue and an additional 21% were drawn from mid-sized companies with revenues of $100m to $1bn. The balance of survey takers (39%) came from companies with less than $100m in annual sales. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/608466-120x120.jpg?3" alt="Source:" width="120" height="120">CMO report shows marketers risk missing revenue targetsChief Marketing Officer Council research has revealed that self-reliant buying and digital-first customer strategies have placed marketing at the center...11 May 2021The Business Leader Scorecard of Marketing reveals:Revenue and sales growth is the top deliverable for marketing report 80% of survey respondents with customer acquisition and profitability a close second (71%) 69% of business executives are extremely or moderately confident in marketing’s ability to lead growth recovery in 202184% are closely, regularly, or increasingly interacting with marketing team 46% rate marketing team performance as very good or exceptional in 2020; a further 45% say it was moderateCollaboration and alignment between lines of business, functional areas and marketing is viewed as close, balanced, effective and well-integrated by 37% of respondents; the same percentage say it is getting better all the time.“Business leaders appear to have more confidence in marketing leadership with 62% of survey respondents considering the essential role of the CMO as ‘customer experience advocate and champion’ in their organisation,” notes Donovan Neale-May, executive director of the CMO Council, which has 16,000 members in 10,000 companies worldwide. “The fact that the secondary view of CMOs is ‘digital transformation/marketing automation leader’ is also a real plus give the modernization mandate in a digitally connected world.”On the other hand, business leaders are looking for marketing to step up in five key areas of performance and value creation.
