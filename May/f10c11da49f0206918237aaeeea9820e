However, procedures are in place to preserve the continuity and integrity of the panel.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/604410.jpg" alt="Broadcast Research Council to commission a more comprehensive TAMS audit" width="120" height="120">Broadcast Research Council to commission a more comprehensive TAMS auditThere have been rapid changes in the recent video viewing landscape exacerbated by the Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant accelerated changes in access to alternate video services and data...8 Apr 2021In the case of any households losing access to TV signal due to the DTT switch over or any other any unusual viewing behaviour for that matter, Nielsen (charged with maintaining and recording of TV audience measurement) waits for three days for the anomaly to correct and then calls the household to assess the cause of change.In tandem with the DTT rollout schedule (as indicated below), Nielsen’s call centre will communicate with Free-To-Air Households to enquire if they have received and installed the DTT decoder. Government has committed to subsidise households with a combined household income of less than R3 200 per month. Households that do not qualify for fully subsidised government decoders have an option of buying new integrated digital television (IDTV) sets that have the DTT decoding capability built in.Whitaker confirms, “Should a TAMS panel household lose access to TV signal due to the switch off and no DTT box or decoder is installed thereafter, the household will be replaced with a lookalike household, ensuring a balanced representative panel.”“To date, the TAMS Panel has remained in full working order with no reports of loss of signal, but to reiterate, we have continuous monitoring and procedures in place for any unusual viewing behaviour,” concludes Whitaker.Project timeline estimations for the phased switch-off of analogue TV transmitters by province:Free State: March 2021 Northern Cape: April 2021North West: May 2021Mpumalanga: May 2021Eastern Cape: May 2021Kwa-Zulu Natal: July 2021Western Cape: November 2021Limpopo: December 2021Gauteng: January 2022Call centre number for aftercare service: 086 736 832
