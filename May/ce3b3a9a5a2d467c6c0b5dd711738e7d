The campaign also picked up a nod from the Creative Circle Awards for April. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/612163.jpg" alt="Howard Audio pulls off a real zinger for KFC" width="450" height="450">Check out the award-winning campaign below: <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/612164.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="267">KFC - "Good burns vs Bad burns"
