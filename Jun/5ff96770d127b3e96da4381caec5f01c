The Young Ones Student Awards showcases advertising, digital communication and design students. The programme offers three separate awards: Young Ones ADC Student Awards offering students the chance to earn an ADC Cube by competing in the same disciplines and categories as the ADC Annual Awards; Young Ones Brief competition, which tasks a team of college students with creating client work with the chance to earn a One Show Pencil; and Young Ones Portfolio competition, where students submit 6-15 pieces of their work and have it judged by industry professionals.A complete showcase of all Young Ones winners can be viewed here.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/613791.jpg" alt="Young Ones Student Awards 2021 announces winning schools, students" width="625" height="351">Top winners this year include the following:Young Ones ADC Student Awards 2021 winners (22 Gold, 23 Silver, 36 Bronze, 111 Merit):This year’s Young Ones ADC Student Awards Gold Cube winners are:Berghs School of Communication Stockholm for “Leitzel Stretch” in Typography: Typefaces / Font Systems Brigham Young University Provo “The Hands that Feed You” for Carhartt in Advertising: Television / Film / Online VideoBrigham Young University Provo “The Hands that Feed You” for Carhartt in Motion / Film Craft: CinematographyBrigham Young University Provo “Life's Journey” for Ford in Advertising: Craft - Art Direction Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg Ludwigsburg “Never Again” for Mario Dahl in Advertising: Television / Film / Online VideoFilmakademie Baden-Württemberg Ludwigsburg “The Red Button” for Kneipp in Advertising: Craft in Video / Audio: SoundFilmakademie Baden-Württemberg Ludwigsburg “Revived” for Duracell in Advertising: Television / Film / Online VideoFilmakademie Baden-Württemberg Ludwigsburg “Revived” for Duracell in Motion / Film Craft: CinematographyFilmakademie Baden-Württemberg Ludwigsburg “Revived” for Duracell in Motion / Film Craft: DirectionFilmakademie Baden-Württemberg Ludwigsburg “Revived” for Duracell in Motion / Film Craft: EditingFilmakademie Baden-Württemberg Ludwigsburg “Revived” for Duracell in Advertising: Craft - Art Direction Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) Baltimore for “Her Street” in Advertising: Out of Home - Print / Electronic Billboard & Transit Miami Ad School Mexico with Miami Ad School Mumbai for “Her Street” in Advertising: Out of Home - Print / Electronic Billboard & TransitMing Chi University of Technology (MCUT) New Taipei City ““Tambu telescopic ambulance” for Kenda Rubber Ind.
