Not you succumbing to this awful virus! What a loss to @BrandPrimedia. You were the BOSS of outside broadcasts; elections, inaugurations, the best technical manager. And that laugh? EVERYTHING made you laugh! You & @AkiAnastasiou & @thomasmmanamela made life beautiful pic.twitter.com/f7rPqrl3QT— Redi Tlhabi (@RediTlhabi) June 30, 2021
