The 2021 Agency of the Year is Cossette and the Network of the Year goes to McCann Worldgroup. Cosette’s award-winning work“We’re thrilled to be named Agency of the Year at this year’s Gerety Awards,” says Peter Ignazi, Global chief creative officer at Cossette. “The common thread that weaves all of this work together is humanity: the special bond of friendship, the resiliency of sick children and their families, and the quiet compassion that comes from speaking your truth — these campaigns resonate because they reflect parts of our shared human existence back at us. To have that recognised by a trailblazing all-female jury is an honour.”Joe Public United scoops Gold at Gerety Awards 20216 Sep 2021Cossette is awarded agency of the year with one Gold, two Silver, one Bronze and five Shortlisted works, which included:Gold: Health Cut; SickKids Moms Vs.
