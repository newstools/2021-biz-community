Swanepoel: The way we have been doing marketing for the past 10 years is changing, and changing fast. Among other things, privacy changes will affect how we reachboth our customers and objectives. The environment is becoming increasinglydifficult and complex; this means it is more important than ever to have anintegrated approach to marketing.Jensen: The online advertising industry has shown healthy growth in spite of the Covid-19 pandemic, and has been able to claim a bigger part of the industry. Melwa: 2020 was a huge growth year for digital in South Africa. Not only in numbers, but more importantly in user behaviour. Lockdowns and social distancing meant that digital had to become part of our everyday lives. The online world entrenched itself into our lives and we believe these changes are here to stay. Prior: Advertising on TV taking into consideration the new connected TV platforms..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} Talk us through some of the key insights that determined which changes, updates, constants will be happening in the digital advertising industry in 2021.Swanepoel:The rise of privacy: Globally, users have made it very clear that their privacy and behaviours are not a marketing right. As marketers, we will need to adjust our approach to how we target and consider more carefully what value exchange we are offering once we get a user to our website or app.Modelled marketing: Due to the rise of privacy, our analytics and audience platforms are going to be increasingly reliant on modelled solutions. This means that our front-end leads and measurement is not going to be as refined as it was in the past. We need to supplement our traditional measurement with more holistic solutions.Jensen: Total advertising revenue grew by 18% to R4.7bn. Although not to the same extent, this is what has also been seen in other territories: the UK showed 5% YoY growth and the US 2.2.% YoY growth. Internet advertising revenue as a percentage of total size of the advertising market increased from 13% to 21% in South Africa. This showed that as consumers spent more time online during the pandemic, the advertising dollars followed the consumer. Whether this is sustainable remains to be seen, but it has definitely caused a very significant shift in a short time. Melwa: The adoption, penetration and use of digital dramatically accelerated in South Africa in 2020. We see three core insights from the digital landscapes report for 2020:Internet users are becoming younger and wealthier. The under-35 segment grew tremendously year-on -year, as well as people earning over R20,000 per month.Internet connectivity is more readily accessible. We saw a 21% increase in people who have internet connectivity at home other than on their mobile device.More day-to-day activities and entertainment are being carried out online. The likes of shopping online, online banking, studying online, online gaming, streaming TV and listening to podcasts all saw double digit growth year on year.Prior:More and more users are migrating to connected TV platforms making addressable TV a reality.Connected TV inventory is growing - in the USA, 78% of households accessible via Connected TV.There has been a 122% increase in global programmatic ad spend in CTV over 2020..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} What one main call to action would you advise your fellow industry colleagues at this time to help companies who are looking to beat the benchmark in digital advertising and create great work (teams, processes etc) that exceeds business goals?Swanepoel: Ensure your current measurement and benchmarks are set up in such a waythat the changes won’t leave you with gaps in your measurement and understanding. An example of this is new vs. returning users, a metric we have all relied heavily on in the past. Non-Google browsers have limited first party cookies (only keeping data for one to seven days) this means that one user can be labelled a new user every day they come to the site, completely throwing your metrics off. This means that new vs returning users is no longer a metric you can use, you need to find other metrics to measure instead.Melwa: People’s behaviours online have adapted and evolved very quickly due to Covid-19 and advertisers need to stay ahead of the increased adoption of digital and behavioural changes online. Know how your customers are engaging online and how your brands can best meet their needs, as they have evolved very quickly. Prior: Start buying digital TV..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} Please share one key learning from 2020 that you have personally (or professionally) taken on board, that you believe will assist others to navigate the future of work as we (are getting to) know it?Swanepoel: Boundary setting. Digital has always worked on an always-on basis. When need be, optimisations or actions can be taken 27/7. With working from home becoming the new normal, I have seen numerous colleagues and friends unable to shut down leading to burn out. Right now, it is more important than ever to have working hours and the resolve to stick to them. With becoming a father to a Covid baby, it meant that for the first year of my son’s life there was no nanny, day mother or creche. I had to work out the intricacies of being a 7-5 strategist while being a full-time father. He made it much easier for me to find the boundaries and hold my colleagues, client and self to these boundaries.Jensen: Whilst not in the advertising industry, I believe now more than ever, we have to be flexible and willing to do things in different ways than what you were used to. I have also learned that it is critical for teams to connect properly, something which is difficult to do virtually.Melwa: Always be willing to allocate resources and time to innovating and evolving. Never take the status quo as a given and always put your company on the edge of innovation. Test, test, test. Prior: Video advertising knowledge in South Africa is not as deep as it should be and advertisers don’t all understand the standards that are available across the different platforms. Video is not just video.The IAB SA has taken its Insight Series online to provide 60 minutes of insights, featuring fellow and future industry leaders, on subjects selected by IAB members and the industry at large to make better digital decisions.
