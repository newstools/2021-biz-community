The idea is to stress-test and audit this piece of work independently, especially if you’re an organisation that struggles with change - meaning your strategy needs to guide for a set one to five years. For example:We need to identify your audience, are they online and if so, how do you reach them? And on what channels, in what regions? So, how do you audit a strategy that you have not even deployed yet? Simple, we have no shortage of tools and historic data to benchmark against. The first step is asking the “why”? Why are we doing this, and to what end?This way, we set up intelligent positioning and measurement metrics for the strategy.Setting specific, measurable, actionable, relevant and time-sensitive objectives will help you gain a better direction and keep stronger control. Doing this allows you to manage and execute according to your outlined KPI’s, meaning efforts are not wasted, and are intentional.Deciding where to spend your digital marketing budget requires us to consider multiple factors. Taking a social media element of the strategy… for example, you might want to ask: Which social media platform resonates most with your brand vocale, style and of course target audience? Is this platform also where your audience is?  How does social media align to your business needs or objectives and have you set KPIs for this channel? Competitor review, which social media channels are your competitors in, how can you compete with their presence?This approach is merely one of a few that assist in accurately measuring and deploying your efforts. The concept is to align your channels to your audience’s personas and behavioural patterns. Questions to ask yourself and your organisation: Would your customers prefer it if you provided customer service via WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or Telegram? Would your customers prefer to learn more about your product or service via video tutorials or webinars or text-based deployments? What is considered to be engage-worthy and growable content, resulting in higher engagement?  Do you have your benchmarks in place? Are you still considering reach and following, or have you woken up to REAL KPIs?Just some more questions worth asking when creating your digital marketing strategy.2. Infrastructure and supportOnce our objectives are clear, it’s time to set up the frameworks and infrastructure to support these objectives and drive real-benefit and bottom lines. a. InfrastructureThis includes everything from data-management, software, telecommunications to applications for productivity and much more. This is the part of your business that is needed to assist your people in doing their jobs, reporting, measurements and of course effective management. A good digital marketing audit will consist of a thorough infrastructure review to see if it supports your business as it should.b. ApplicationsTo further reap the benefits of digital infrastructure, you’ll need the right applications for the right use cases.Some key questions when setting this up, can be... Which applications do you need to install on your e-commerce site to encourage conversions and follow-up? Have you done some comparison in the marketplace? How do you intend to manage your CRM efforts better? What do your client’s value most? Have you considered marketing automation software and tools? And if so, have you done some testing and beta studies? What tracking and measurement tools and applications are you intending to use and does it match your desired outputs?Running through an example of starting a campaign that involves automated email sending with the appropriate tagging upon conversion and consequent SMS supporting outreach to a customer with questions about the user experience.In such a case, an advanced marketing automation solution needs to be utilised and the staff needs to be trained. The required software and hardware need to be installed, tested and then deployed.One of the major questions involves your data management, including the storage and quality of emails in the database. Do you have the right tools for the database clean-up and thereafter management? We know companies with over 10 million emails in the database and over 80% email bounce rate upon every campaign. To work with Big Data the infrastructure and right applications are crucial for successful execution.And an additional important question arises regarding the tools for measuring the campaign results. Define your KPIs! 3. Creative/designOften, the main goal of conducting a digital marketing audit of your creative/design aspects is to evaluate and enhance your branding strategy/appeal and uplift of brand recognisability and reputation. Design plays a huge role in branding. It helps your target audience to visualise your brand identity, making you memorable to them.How you design your digital assets helps your prospects and customers make long-term depictions of your brand mission and vision, values, uniqueness and creative flair. For example...Think of what you conceive to be a brand’s identity when you browse the website. Do the graphics have a lasting impression on you? How easily does the desktop website or mobile version layout make it to find the information you need, and how does that make you feel? The colors, illustrations, and brand voice are easy to identify anywhere online or on just on various social media platforms? Is design consistent? Are you deploying A/B split testing to ensure a solid return and drive up engagement?A design audit will help improve your creative/design elements so you can visually engage your target audience. That way, you can help them form a strong emotional bond with your brand personality.A design/branding audit can help you achieve key outcomes such as: Create an effective visual communication strategy and tactical plan Create and use only designs that resonate with your preferred brand identity, and brand voice Ensure your digital assets help visualise a consistent message across multiple online channels Ensure your brand logo, color theme and topography are consistent throughout your website and social media platformsThat brings us to perhaps the most popular component of a digital marketing audit.4.
