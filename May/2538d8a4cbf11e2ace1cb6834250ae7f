The 2021 Awards again recognise creative excellence from the past year and commend the industry for creating exceptional work during unprecedented times reiterating the awards manifesto that ‘work that matters must be seen’. Alongside the Craft, Next, Advertising and Side Hustle categories, D&AD announced the Pencil winners for this year's Collaborative category at the ceremony. These awards celebrate long-lasting relationships between clients and their design, advertising and/or production companies that have led to the creation of noteworthy work in recent years. The first for advertising agency was awarded to Brazil’s AlmapBBDO for their continued work with Alpargatas and the second for design agency was awarded to UK-based Superunion for their work alongside The London Symphony Orchestra.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2010/578387-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Loeries2020: &amp;quot;By thinking creatively we can create moments of connection and delight&amp;quot; - Katherina Tudball" width="120" height="120">#Loeries2020: "By thinking creatively we can create moments of connection and delight" - Katherina TudballI chatted to the international jury presidents ahead of the upcoming Loeries Creative Week.

We hope the first of our two virtual ceremonies has provided an opportunity for the industry to come together to view, be inspired by and celebrate the immense talent across the creative community. We have taken many of the learnings from last year's digital awards and implemented them this year to create an experience that holds true to the value of our awards and celebrates every single pencil winner as they truly deserve to be. We are looking forward to our second ceremony to once again reveal more outstanding work as well as the winners of our highly coveted Black Pencils, the President’s Award and Companies of the Year.”D&AD this year continues to platform the most exceptional work from the past 12 months, following the same rigorous judging process that holds creativity to the highest standards. Famously tough to win, there are no quotas for D&AD Awards, meaning that the number of awarded entries fluctuates each year. In some years, no Black Pencils - the highest creative accolade - are awarded. The highest ever awarded in one year currently stands at eight. Winning work will not only receive an esteemed D&AD Pencil, it will also be featured in the digital D&AD Annual and online archive – a definitive guide for creatives all around the world.The Pencil winners for the Design, Impact and Culture categories alongside the presentation of Black Pencils, The President's Award and Companies of the Year will be announced in the second virtual ceremony tomorrow night, on 27 May at 7pm.
