You can’t be everything to everyone, so knowing who your brand is not, is also helpful in guiding the life of the brand.”When it comes to developing a brand for their clients, hoola takes a ‘business leads brand’ approach. “No one is going to spend money if they aren’t going to make money from it; business and brand need to work together closely to create real value and success.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/602531-120x120.png?2" alt="Boosting brand purpose by solving value-action gaps in Africa" width="120" height="120">Boosting brand purpose by solving value-action gaps in AfricaHow do corporations best articulate and act upon their brand purpose, as the interface between corporations and society?

The insights gained through those conversations empower them as an agency to develop a solid foundation for a brand, which is key for consistency and strengthening the brand equity, and therefore, the client’s business in the process.Taking a brand to market for the first time can be a daunting prospect. However, Van Breda believes that the brand development process allows their clients to feel confident in the work they have produced.“We know a brand is ready to launch when it’s been based on thorough research and testing, and it clearly stands out amongst others without overlapping, because it looks, sounds and feels fresh.“And, of course, when clients get goosebumps, dance around the boardroom with joy or shout “YES!” when we reveal their new brand - we know we’ve got a winner!” concludes van Breda.
