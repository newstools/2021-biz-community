My typical day kicks off with me scrolling through my feed for the latest updates on all things tech and news. Thereafter, it's a quick tea session with my colleagues where we catch up on what's happened overnight and what we need to do for the day, followed by checking my emails. Depending on the day planned, it usually entails meetings with our partners as well as our agencies. I go through my to-do list as the day progresses, and depending on the day - I either have lunch at my desk or with my colleagues in our canteen area..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} Can you tell us a bit more about your career journey prior to your current role? I started my career at the Sunday Times and The Citizen as a journalist. I am a sports lover, and as such also worked as a sports analyst on a TV breakfast show. I decided to move into PR and communications when I joined Fleishman Hillard in 2013. After a year at the agency, I joined Huawei, where I worked for over six years. Here I was building the brand from the foundation phase in the smartphone market to one of the leading technology brands in South Africa. Last year I decided it was time for a new chapter and challenge. That’s when I decided to join OPPO.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/611029.jpg" alt="Humans trump chatbots for customer retention" width="120" height="120">Humans trump chatbots for customer retentionThe importance of retaining a business' current customer base is often overlooked...By Mathew Conn 3 days ago.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} What do you love most about working in the marketing space?I like that as a marketer I have room to get creative while also being pragmatic.

We work with 80+ top operators worldwide and have over 400,000 retail outlets across the world.

We need to consider the message we are trying to convey, the audience and what we want to achieve. We use various platforms online and through broadcast and print, while also keeping a close eye on our digital activities..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} What advice would you give to brands looking to match the shift that comes with living through a pandemic?I’d say companies need to plan for everything, especially for potential risks to their brand reputation. We are undoubtedly in the era of the customer - communication no longer needs to be done in one particular way. Consumers are publishers, and we need to ensure that they have positive things to say about our brands. A good reputation is perceived to offer more value, which can result in sustained business growth. Unfortunately, this growth can be eroded if true measures of reputational risk are not in place. Recent examples have shown that most companies place effort in handling threats to reputation only once the risks have been realised. Companies that have better control of their reputation and the risks associated with it are those that pro actively plan and create possible risk scenarios. This also helps with being adaptive and agile - a common practice during a pandemic.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/610873-120x120.jpg?2" alt="How to motivate your team to produce good work, even during a global pandemic" width="120" height="120">How to motivate your team to produce good work, even during a global pandemicThere are a number of effective strategies you can implement within your teams now to ensure you can harness that collaborative mentality and motivate your team to produce creative work, at a distance...Issued by Silversoft 3 days ago.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} What career advice would you give to aspiring marketing professionals?It is important to acquire knowledge about the various marketing techniques.
