<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/612460.jpg" alt="Forbes Africa announces 30 Under 30 for 2021" width="805" height="792">In previous years, the list has featured names such as Mr. Eazi, Lloyd Harris, Siya Kolisi, Sho Madjozi, Bruce Diale, Karabo Poppy, Thuso Mbedu, Nomzamo Mbatha, Burna Boy, Nthabiseng Mosia, Davido, Shamim Nabuuma Kaliisa, Nasty C and WizKid.  This year’s list marks a historic turn as many businesses and brands were adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The editorial team curating the list sifted through countless nominations looking for resourcefulness and resilience in candidates, so crucial at this time in rebuilding and contributing to the African growth story. Their extensive research was also vetted by audit partner, SNG Grant Thornton, and a panel of judges and subject-matter experts on the continent.  “The Forbes Africa 30 Under 30 list is our most coveted list of the year, and what makes this year’s compilation even more compelling is the fighting spirit of the candidates who made it through a turbulent year. They need to be honoured for their tenacity as leaders charting a non-linear trajectory to success, and they are also representative of Africa’s greater talent trove that they will in turn help shine a light on,” says Renuka Methil, managing editor of Forbes Africa.
