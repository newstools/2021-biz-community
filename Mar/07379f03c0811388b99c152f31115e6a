The entry process has been redesigned for this year’s competition, making it easier than ever for Little Black Book members to submit their free entries.Having successfully taken last year’s judging sessions online, the Immortal Awards will once again be hosting a series of virtual judging sessions at the end of the year to determine 2021’s winners.The Immortal Awards expanded in 2020 with a series of regional competitions in which regional work was judged by dedicated regional juries. The competitions, which cover North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East & Africa, proved a huge success and return this year. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2012/588997-120x120.png?2" alt="All the Immortal Awards 2020 winners!" width="120" height="120">All the Immortal Awards 2020 winners!The winners of the 2020 Immortal Awards have been announced and just four projects have been crowned Immortal by this year's jury...7 Dec 2020The best work from each region will receive finalist status and qualify for the final, global round of judging. A hand-picked grand jury, composed of jurors from each regional jury, will decide which projects – if any – will receive an Immortal Award or a Commendation in November. Paul Monan, awards director, says: “For three years we’ve worked tirelessly on growing the Immortal Awards, always with the belief that the industry needed something different. The last year threw a lot at everyone but throughout we saw a desire to celebrate the great creative work from the previous 12 months. Ultimately, we saw an incredible 50% increase in entries last year, with work coming from 52 countries, more than we’ve ever had. We safely moved the awards online and, as jury rooms became jury Zooms, watched our jurors passionately debating each and every project as they would in a normal jury room. We can’t wait to do it all again this year and showcase the very best creativity from all corners of the world.”Entries into The Immortal Awards will be accepted until 10 September 2021.
