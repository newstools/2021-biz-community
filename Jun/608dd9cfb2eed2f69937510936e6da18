Time is running out to invest in the fastest growing industry on the planet, with the section 12J tax investment incentive, which ends on the 30 June 2021.“Astute investors still have an opportunity to invest in a brand new asset class, behind a solid management team, with super high investment returns and a remarkable 45% tax refund on your total investment,” Grovest CEO and co-founder Jeff Miller exclaims.And now SilverLeaf offers an innovative financing solution for investors.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/614001.png" alt="Funding provided, 0% interest for investments in SilverLeaf" width="1620" height="1620">The investment SilverLeaf Investments is offering investors the opportunity of a lifetime to achieve returns of more than 20% per annum. The 12J Fund is managed by a team of highly experienced corporate finance and industry experts with the collective aim of being the leading investment fund in the South African cannabis and hemp industry. “Our first investment has already been made in one of the most advanced cannabis export businesses, with our first harvest ready before the end of the year. We also have access to international investments and a very sunny disposition investing into this magical plant's growth potential,” Cliff Giesenow, joint CEO of SilverLeaf Investments, says.Minimum investment and payment terms The investment range is between R100,000 (min.) and R2.5m (max.). Therefore, a R50,000 deposit paid before 30 June is all that is needed to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Pay the balance (R50,000) of your deposit before 28 February 2022 with 0% interest to make up the R100,000 investment! At least 100 shares at R1,000 p/share is the minimum investment required (R100,000), with the maximum investment being 2,500 shares or R2,5m. Companies can invest up to R5m. If the investment made is more than R500,000 worth of shares, the balance payment after deposit will be split over two payments one on 28 February 2022 and the next on 31 December 2022.Why the time is now? When 12J was created, it was given a 12-year lifespan as well as a ‘sunset clause’ that expires on 30 June 2021. This allows taxpayers one more investment window into 12J, allowing them to make their investment by 30 June.The Grovest team has been part of the 12J journey since its inception. “It has been a privilege to watch it grow, not just in terms of investment returns, but also in terms of job creation, economic stimulation and providing SMEs with access to capital they wouldn’t have had otherwise,” says Jeff Miller. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/612196.png" alt="South African taxpayers' last opportunity to choose where their tax money goes - invest before 30 June" width="120" height="120">South African taxpayers' last opportunity to choose where their tax money goes - invest before 30 JuneThis is your last chance to choose where your tax money goes.
