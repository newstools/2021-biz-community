The campaign seeks to create awareness and inspire collective action to mitigate, minimise and manage Covid-19 and its effects. The insurer is also supporting governments efforts to drive education on Covid-19 safety protocols and vaccine messages across mass media channels.“Covid-19 has caused significant devastation across the world, and according to experts the virus could be with us for some time. If we do not remain active, educated, and motivated to beat the virus, complacency could set in. This could lead to an unnecessary spike in infections, sickness and deaths, leaving the virus to remain a real threat to people across the continent. As a responsible business, we want to ensure that we support community-level initiatives that show dedication and commitment to fighting the spread of this virus,” says Tshabalala.Here, she tells us about her career and work with financial services brands and more about how the insurer is lending a helping hand as a corporate business to make sure that there is some level of sustainability for such initiatives….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Thobile, as head of Brand at Old Mutual, tell us more about your role and what it entails exactly?My role is to implement the overall brand strategies and marketing-related plans to build and grow the Old Mutual brand, ultimately leading to increased awareness and relevance for Old Mutual Limited.

From a marketing perspective, we have had to be very mindful of the prevailing tone and adjust our initiatives accordingly.
