We want as many people to share how they are showing their support for the team and that support will be felt by the players as they take on the world champions in South Africa. “We look forward to sharing some of these videos with the team and management throughout the Tour.”PT SportSuite CEO Rich Cheary said: “The spirit and purpose of this new Lions Fan Zone, comes at a unique and defining moment in world sport and digital engagement, with Covid-19 having forced us to re-think the needs of the fan and how to provide a safe, simple and rewarding way for them to engage.“We’ve partnered with the British and Irish Lions to bring something different and compelling, giving sponsors and supporters across the four nations and of varying demographics an equal opportunity to contribute towards a digital “Sea of Red” before, during and after every match. There is an opportunity to uncover and share some of the untold fan stories that bring to life this unique Lions Tour in an authentic way.”TO CHECK OUT THE OFFICIAL LIONS FAN ZONE, VISIT LIONSRUGBY.COM/FANZONE
