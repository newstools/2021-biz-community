Tell us what you did to reach this level and what it takes to find success on the platform.Isaacs: Thank you so much. Honestly, I just remained consistent with my uploads and for every video, I put out I tried my best to bring the best part of me forward. YouTube requires dedication, lots of it..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}I noticed that you bought a new warehouse late last year. Can you tell us about that and the new business ventures you’ve started?Isaacs: Gino Lange, an extremely good friend of mine, pitched me an idea to start a customs shop in Paarl, Western Cape. I was taken aback because all my life I wanted to be part of a business where not only my channel can grow but where can help build a business that is authentic and from the heart. Where I can go through difficulty in order to grow and develop. It's a custom car shop called L.A Customs where we build customs cars and do vehicle wrapping..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What all needs to be done in order for you to create a quality video that will get lots of views and increase your number of subscribers?Isaacs: Firstly is an idea, once you have that idea for the particular vehicle you are shooting you then film it and see that idea come to life. I don't worry about how many subscribers I have and how many views the video gets. I do it because I enjoy it. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the significance of electric mobility and how it will change the automotive landscape in South Africa.Isaacs: Unfortunately, I don't have much experience here, and to speak of this now is too early. We simply don't have the infrastructure yet and electric cars in South Africa are extremely expensive..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}I know that you are a devout petrol head. But do you think South African youth need to develop a sense of affection for electric cars? If so, why?Isaacs: I had the opportunity to drive BMW's i3 and I was completely blown away by it. I couldn't believe the acceleration but also how quiet it was. Once the youth start seeing what these cars do at our local race tracks, they are surely going to come round..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you think the most important thing is for youth in South Africa when it comes to cars and why?Isaacs: Cars keep youth out of trouble, they stir emotions and put a smile on your face, they keep you away from doing wrong as they keep you occupied. That feeling of your foot on the throttle, lovely exhaust note at the back and a good song on the radio, there is nothing like it. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/611932.jpg" alt="In conversation with Sabelo Nxele AKA 'The Car Guy'" width="120" height="120">In conversation with Sabelo Nxele AKA 'The Car Guy'Nxele reveals the reason he willingly gives out valuable advice to car buyers on social media.
