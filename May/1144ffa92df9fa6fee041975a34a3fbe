The finding illustrate that local online retail more than doubled in just two years, thanks to the explosion in demand for home deliveries brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.“The most astonishing aspect of this total is that it is more than double the R14,1bn reached in 2018, in just two years,” says World Wide Worx MD Arthur Goldstuck, principal analyst on the research project. “It is also 50% higher than the total forecast for 2020 three years ago, when online retail in South Africa was expected to reach R20bn by 2020.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/602803-120x120.jpg?2" alt="How a year of lockdown reshaped online retail" width="120" height="120">How a year of lockdown reshaped online retailDerek Cikes, commercial director at part-payment platform Payflex, outlines some of the key pandemic-led changes to the retail landscape over the past 365 days...Issued by Payflex 26 Mar 2021Online outpaces traditional retailThe figure comes into the most dramatic context when it is compared to traditional retail. In 2018, the R14,1bn in online retail represented 1.4% of total retail, estimated at the time at R1,07tn. Online had outpaced traditional retail growth throughout the past 20 years, since it came off a low base, but traditional retail still grew every year until 2019. In 2020, it slumped as a result of lockdown as well as economic stress. According to preliminary data from Stats SA, at current prices, total retail fell by 4.2%, to R1,05tn at current prices. The percentage of retail made up by online retail sales came to 2.8% – exactly double the percentage for 2018.Online retail revenue more than doubled in 2020, compared to 2018. The #OnlineRetailSA report shows this is expected to continue to grow exponentially in the coming years.
