Following this meeting, RocoMamas confirms that Rack’n Grill has been granted permission to utilise the RocoMamas registered trade mark 'Smash Burgers, for its current business format. Going forward, RocoMamas will address the manner in which these matters are handled and sincerely apologises to its customers and all affected."@RacknGrill pic.twitter.com/v4kYsTyEuf— RocoMamas® (@rocomamas) April 21, 2021 Kasu has however voiced his disagreement with the information supplied in the RocoMamas statement. According to Kasu, the statement released was meant to be a joint statement agreed to by both parties, which ended up not being the case.A Rack n Grill statement shared to social media said: While we were in good faith waiting for RocoMamas to issue us with a draft press statement which were are happy to release together as agreed in [Tuesday's] meeting between the parties, they went ahead and published their own version without our approval. We strongly deny the content thereof. It is also in stark contrast to the preliminary agreements reached between the parties."Here’s our response to Rocomamas’ earlier press statement.@Jehad_Kasu @GasantAbarder @RobinAdamsZA @Ya_a_seen_Him @VOCfm @Fin24 @IOL pic.twitter.com/Su390OIQ72— Rack 'n Grill (@RacknGrill) April 21, 2021 Public sentiment has largely been in support of Rack n Grill, and the RocoMamas statement and apology seems only to have fuelled further outrage.What is this @rocomamas?'Giving permission to use the words smash burger?'��������������And is that even an apology? You owe @RacknGrill an apology.You're taking the piss! pic.twitter.com/juxPIOPpnT— Gasant Abarder (@GasantAbarder) April 21, 2021 It’s where @rocomamas write “Following this meeting, #RocoMamas confirms that Rack’n Grill has been granted permission to utilise the RocoMamas registered trade mark “Smash Burgers” that gets my back up. Pls we’re not stupid. RocoMamas didn’t invent smash burgers. ‘Tsek— Gina Howse (@Gina_Howse) April 22, 2021 @rocomamas failed at the first hurdle. Terrible response, arrogant to the end.
