Over 100 participating designers, studios and brands will host launches, exhibitions, presentations, talks and displays during the month. The new trail gives participants one-on-one access to showrooms and private maker spaces.The trail has been divided into a series of curated routes, each with its theme. For example, if you are interested in art, you will be able to follow the art route. Similarly, if you are in the process of renovating, you’ll be able to follow the route that clusters together suppliers such as fittings, tiles, mirrors, frameless glass, etc.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Decorex Africa (@decorexafrica) Some of the routes you’ll be able to cover on foot, others will require motorised transport to reach all the designated stops. You can drive, take an Uber or hop on a specially commissioned Cape Town Design Trail Red Bus. These public transport buses are usually dedicated to tourism but have come on board for June to support the event, with tickets to ride at specially reduced trail rates. All the curated routes will be available online. There will be a separate map for each route, and each participant has their own geotag on the relevant map.Here are some of the routes to experience:Design An entire firmament of the city’s design stars has come out for the trail. Haldane Martin and Willowlamp, both renowned Cape Town-based studios, are two award-winning ‘veterans’ of local design, having earned their stripes on both the local and international front over two decades. Willowlamp is launching new wall sconces and throwing open its factory to the public throughout the month. Other well-known local names to watch out for include Kirsten Goss, Bofred, Andrea Brand, Meyer von Wielligh and Kino. Clout SA and HUB will be launching to the public for the first time as part of the trail, hosting a stimulating showcase of all-new South African design including pieces by Joburg-based designers Thabisa Mjo and The Urbanative, who were voted Designers of the Year at 100% Design South Africa, as well as a new bench and light by the winner of the 2020 Nando’s Hot Young Designer (HYD) talent search. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2010/580357-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nando's Hot Young Designer Talent Search 2020 finalists revealed" width="120" height="120">Nando's Hot Young Designer Talent Search 2020 finalists revealedFor the 2020 edition of HYD, young designers were asked to create a unique bench that responds sensitively to seating needs in a time of social distancing...13 Oct 2020Major design nodes across the city form part of the trail, too.
