They have been subversive and provocative, and they have tackled the issues of the day head-on; but they have also produced work that remains significant, urgent and inspiring today. Last year, Business and Arts South Africa recognised the value of the SBYA programme by giving its Long-Term Partnership Award to Standard Bank and the National Arts Festival. Festival CEO, Monica Newton, observed on that occasion:After all these years the SBYA Award is still an award that artists aspire to and one that the public recognises as a major endorsement. The recipients often go on to become household names overnight. We would like to extend gratitude to our partner Standard Bank, not just for this project but for their continued commitment to supporting South African talent.Newton also offered her warm congratulations to the 2021 Standard Bank Young Artists. “Young artists in South Africa need the inspiration these individuals embody. Standard Bank Young Artists represent the reward for years of hard work and determination and remind us that we have great talent in our midst. I would like to recognise the exceptional achievements of the 2021 Standard Bank Young Artists; and we look forward to seeing them perform and exhibit at the National Arts Festival in 2022 and to seeing how they use this accolade to further their artistic dreams and ambitions.”  The young artists of 2021:Kristi-Leigh Gresse has collaborated with a remarkable variety of South Africa’s dancers and choreographers, developing her own ‘voice’ as an artist as her work has cohered thematically around the politics of the body as well as expressions of collective and individual identity. She won a Standard Bank Ovation Gold Award for Sullied at the National Arts Festival in 2018 and went on to win the South East Dance Award at the Brighton Fringe Festival in 2019, before being commissioned to produce a dance screen offering for the digital JOMBA! Festival in 2020.And the winner in the #SBYA2021 Dance category is the formidable @KJGresse ��. pic.twitter.com/nhLBj5vfIc— Standard Bank Arts (@StandardBankArt) September 2, 2021 Vuma Levin is a guitarist whose compositions combine South African musical traditions with jazz, pop and electronics.

Based in Cape Town, he challenges audiences with discomfiting meditations on the politics of representing the body within his immediate South African context and situating these local concerns alongside global considerations.And the winner for the #SBYA2021 in the Performance Art category is the esteemed artiste, Gavin Krastin ����‍�� pic.twitter.com/QlIlWzBzNN— Standard Bank Arts (@StandardBankArt) September 2, 2021 Thando Doni has worked extensively with independent physical theatre company Magnet Theatre and numerous other theatre organisations.
