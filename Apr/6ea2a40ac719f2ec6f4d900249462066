It’s about buying the right digital capabilities, supporting your team in learning the right skills and changing the processes along the way.One of the most essential digital capabilities you can invest in is marketing automation, and it plays a critical role in achieving digital transformation for your company. However, simply knowing this fact is not going to change much for any company.  That’s why we’ve created this blog post to help you understand why automation is essential for your company’s digital transformation and how you should go about doing it.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2002/540450.jpg" alt="Marketing automation in Southern Africa - a software or strategy?" width="120" height="120">Marketing automation in Southern Africa - a software or strategy?"Powerful automation software helps mechanise marketing processes and when leveraged successfully, it helps drive transactions and generates more revenue" explains Engagement Factory's Stuart Ormiston...Issued by Engagement Factory 27 Feb 2020Why change? The world has evolved and, with it, so have your customers. Unlike in the past, they now can select and choose which services they interact with, which to block out and give negative reviews online. It’s more important now than ever to put your customers at the centre of everything your company does. To achieve this, businesses must build up a comprehensive experience for their customers with a 360° view of their interactions. They must understand which channels, style of communication they prefer and content they like to consume. This drives customer engagement, reinforcing their investment in the experience while creating a positive feedback loop. However, the only way to do this is through an integrated experience – and this can be a challenge. Organisations often struggle to offer an integrated experience to their customers. This could be down to many factors, but some of the most common reasons include a lack of integration between systems or inefficient processes and poor collaboration due to siloed departments. Some companies even experience an overload of data but no way to generate actionable insights from that data. Others lack a team with the right capabilities and skills. Whatever the reason, the result is the same – the company becomes stagnant, their customers gradually lose interest, and they struggle to maintain relevance. The truth is, it’s complicated to realise an integrated and consistent customer experience across various touchpoints for multiple clients. Integrated and personalised experiences are created from capturing interactions, analysing the content they view and then tailoring that content – for every single customer. This task is impossible to achieve for businesses with many customers, so marketing automation is critical to offering an integrated customer experience.Optimise your customer engagement through marketing automationCustomers expect better personal engagement, and they expect it to be wherever they are in the moment. One of the best ways to ensure you reach your customers is by taking advantage of the countless digital options we have available to us today. Shifting your customer engagement model toward more digital channels requires a holistic approach. In other words, you have to be everywhere at once. This is where marketing automation comes in. Setting up marketing automation to support this requires time, patience, commitment, training and a willingness to embrace change within your organisation. So how do you bridge the gap from marketing as you know it to engagement with marketing automation? Let’s walk you through it.Four aspects to address for marketing automation transformationTo introduce marketing automation to your company, you need to address the core capabilities of your business.
