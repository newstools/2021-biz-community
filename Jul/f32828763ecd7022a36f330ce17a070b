According to the NAB, the community media projects that have been affected by the violence are non-profit organisations, owned and managed by the communities themselves.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/618847-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Source:" width="120" height="120">Sanef lashes out at damages to community radio stationsThe South African National Editor's Forum has expressed its deep concern for damages against local radio stations as a result of the recent looting and violence in South Africa...1 day agoOne such radio station is Alex FM, which saw high levels of looting and destruction during this week. The station released a statement on 14 July pleading to their community to assist in any way they can to help rebuild the station and resupply their equipment. The incident, according to Alex FM, has left them without a studio entirely. Unfortunately, Alex FM is not the only station to experience this level of looting and destruction - stations like Mams FM and Westside FM have also been affected according to statements released by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa). This is the little thats left by rioters as they looted @AlexFMRadio891. I was with team yday as they went through the rubble trying to make sense of what happened, why someone would target what belongs to the community. It's sad!We continue with our journey to #RebuildAlexFM. pic.twitter.com/3vMTfZrRYa— Isaac Mangena (@Ice_Izo) July 14, 2021 These stations serve their local communities, and often operate on shoestring budgets. Nadia Bulbulia, executive director of the NAB, said, “They are heavily dependent on donor funding for survival and the impact of such destruction will be very challenging, if not impossible to overcome. We extend our gratitude to all those who are working tirelessly to restore peace and stability back into our communities.” She also added that the NAB is assisting community radio stations wherever possible.
