The viewing experience was at participants’ own pace, in their own homes, using their own devices. Eight ad exposures, representing eight different brands, were embedded into the viewing experience for each treatment type.The ads featured eight different brands and varied in format based on the screen. On the CTV screen, audiences received a standard VDX in-stream ad. On desktop and mobile, the in-page VDX ad units provided an opt-in interactive experience that enabled viewers to explore additional content beyond the main video.Post-viewing, participants were presented with a survey assessing ad effectiveness in categories such as awareness, brand opinion and purchase intent. A total of 445 variables were observed from each of the 480 participants who were surveyed. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2006/558363.png" alt="VDX.tv releases a guide on 'advanced TV': What it is and how it can help drive results" width="120" height="120">VDX.tv releases a guide on 'advanced TV': What it is and how it can help drive resultsVDX.tv, a global technology company specialising in digital advertising, has published a whitepaper on the topic of advanced TV.
