Each experience featured a different award-winning South African: pianist Nduduzo Makhathini; the head chef at The Marabi Club, Katlego Mlambo; and South Africa’s top mixologist George Steven Hunter. These master craftsmen take the listener through a pairing of Courvoisier Cognac with a meal, a cocktail or a piece of music. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/609764.jpg" alt="Howard Audio toasts Courvoisier in unique sonic campaign" width="680" height="511"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/609766.jpg" alt="Howard Audio toasts Courvoisier in unique sonic campaign" width="340" height="453"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/609768.jpg" alt="Howard Audio toasts Courvoisier in unique sonic campaign" width="340" height="453">We recorded the influencers live in-studio, talking us through their pairings in an audio journey packaged for radio and social media. We recorded their live sound effects; the sound of sushi being cut by a knife, recorded though our premium mics in our soundproof studios, is not for the fainthearted! Watching these amazing craftsmen create in-studio was an experience in itself.A huge team effort as always from Howard Audio, with Adam Howard directing the recording sessions; senior engineer Paul Theodorou who final-mixed the experiences; and Belinda Howard who meticulously planned the weeks of recording and mixing.Listen to the food pairing sound experience here:  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/609770.jpg" alt="Howard Audio toasts Courvoisier in unique sonic campaign" width="340" height="140"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/609772.jpg" alt="Howard Audio toasts Courvoisier in unique sonic campaign" width="340" height="140">To learn more about the new Howard Audio and to stay up to date with our latest work be sure to check out our new website at www.howardaudio.co.zaHead of production Belinda Howard:Email: az.oc.oiduadrawoh@adnilebCell: 083 643 7142 <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/609774.png" alt="Check out the behind-the-scenes of the Consol Glass audio branding" width="340" height="211">Check out the behind-the-scenes of the Consol Glass audio branding<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/609776.jpg" alt="See how Howard Audio's logo was made" width="340" height="211">See how Howard Audio's logo was made
