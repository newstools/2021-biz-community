The initiative provides creatives with a way to come together in the fight against racism and intolerance, providing a platform for anti-hate messaging to the general public.  The programme asks creatives to develop poster images that communicate anti-hate messages using a supplied template. Committee and selection processThe selection committee includes these members from The One Club board: Keith Cartwright, president/CCO of CartwrightJudy John, global chief creative director of EdelmanPum Lefebure, co-founder/CCO of Design ArmyPhilippe Meunier, co-founder/CCO of Sid LeeRobert Wong, co-founder of Google Creative LabThese members will be responsible for reviewing the submissions. The work will be showcased on the organisation’s website, social media channels, and in email newsletters with the hope of reaching The One Club’s 400,000 global constituents.  The One Club has partnered on the program with Outfront Media, one of the world’s largest out of home media companies. Outfront has committed to featuring a select number of submissions on digital billboards around the US to raise awareness among the general public and inspire others to play an active role in the fight against hate. Submissions and messageDeadline for the first round of submissions is 18 June 2021. Work will be reviewed and displayed online shortly thereafter, and Outfront will display the first selection of the designs on billboards, transit shelters and other OOH media at the end of June. Lefebure said, “Creativity can change the world. We Are One is an important, urgent call to the creative community to come together as allies, and use our voice, influence and unique skills to take a stand and tell this crucial message to the world.” Kevin Swanepoel, CEO of The One Club, said “Creative activism is a part of The One Club’s DNA. We Are One is in line with our mission to support the global creative community, and take action to promote diversity, equity and inclusion.”Eddy Herty, VP and national creative director of Outfront Studios, said, “Anytime even one of our canvases can be used to speak love and visually inspire someone with a positive uplifting message, we're all for it. Having the opportunity to collaborate with an organisation like The One Club is invaluable as it aligns perfectly with Outfront's purpose, to help people, places and business grow stronger.”UNITED STATES<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/609375-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The One Club opens call for entries for Global Young Guns 19" width="120" height="120">The One Club opens call for entries for Global Young Guns 19The One Club for Creativity has opened the call for entries for Young Guns 19, celebrating international creative professionals aged 30 or younger...13 May 2021The One Club’s mandateThe effort began more than a decade ago when the organisation started its annual Where Are All The Black People diversity conference and career fair. It continued with its global Creative Boot Camps and mentorship programmes for diverse college students and other young creatives.  Last year, the club launched One School, a free portfolio programme for Black creatives now active in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. The programme brought 30 new Black creatives into the industry in its first cohort, and will add another 120 with Spring and Autumn sessions in 2021. Recently, as part of this year’s global awards, the club also announced the creation of The One Show Fusion Pencil and ADC Annual Awards Fusion Cube, with the aim of recognising diversity, equity and inclusion in both content and the teams that made it.
