Changes to the weekend lineup include the addition of Weekends with Danny Painter on Saturdays from 4–7pm, and Sunday Session with DJ Jazzy D on Sundays from 2–6pm. Danny Painter will celebrate Mzansi’s relaxed weekend mode with popular hits and her signature chilled-out but super engaged vibe. “I’m bringing a little less love, and a lot more of the music that you love. My lineup will be peppered with interviews from local and international artists, and I can’t wait to spend my late Saturday afternoons exactly as one should – with our Jacaranda FM family and the great music that connects us,” comments Painter.“Jacaranda FM listeners love how Danny involves them in her popular weekday show – Love Songs with Danny. She’s great at making anyone feel like an old friend, and perfectly suited for the relaxed but connected weekend programming we want to offer our listeners,” said Hennie Myburgh, programme manager at Jacaranda FM.Painter’s Saturday programme will set the perfect tone for The Houseparty with Jazzy D – which kicks-off at 7pm. Jacaranda FM will also add Sunday Sessions with DJ Jazzy D, where he aims to keep the vibe chilled and familiar. DJ Jazzy D will be presenting a series of expertly crafted songs, created to keep you in a relaxed Sunday mood that will have you belting out a ballad or singing along to an all-time favourite.“I always dreamed of having a Sunday Show where I can play the best laid back songs and take listeners on a journey. It’s my seventh year at Jacaranda FM and I am ready to take a step forward with this wonderful opportunity to express a different side of myself and highlight my theoretical music knowledge. Think of the show as your dessert after Sunday lunch,” said DJ Jazzy D.DJ Jazzy D is a Jacaranda FM  audience-favourite with a massive following of music aficionado’s. Jazzy’s Sunday show won’t be an extension of The Houseparty with Jazzy D, but rather an opportunity to showcase his versatility. “I think our listeners will be delighted to see another side of Jazzy, and equally thrilled to have Danny’s presence felt over the weekend,” adds Myburgh. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/607562-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Mornings with Mack: A new dawn at Jacaranda FM" width="120" height="120">Mornings with Mack: A new dawn at Jacaranda FMJacaranda FM is tweaking its lineup to accommodate new radio listener patterns.
