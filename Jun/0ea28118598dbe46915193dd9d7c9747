It is a tremendous honour, which I accept with deep gratitude.

An opportunity to advance new intellectual frontiers in this field and to be able to involve young scholars as partners on the project is a rare gift.”Chair of the trust, Jonathan Oppenheimer, said, “Prof Gobodo-Madikizela is a globally recognised scholar, a luminary in a fractured world in desperate need of healing intergenerational wounds.
