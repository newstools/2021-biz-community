We’re a fun brand, we love the music we play, and we love radio. We hope that our campaign will bring a feel-good factor, and even a smile to those who see it and that they will be encouraged to lock their radio into Hot 102.7FM.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/619141.jpg" alt="Hot 102.7FM takes to the streets" width="950" height="408">The digital billboards have a strong call-to-action with material that reflects the current on-air show, as well as a creative montage of some of the artists that listeners can expect to hear on Hot 102.7FM. “We’re getting a great response to the station,” adds Madurai. “Our WhatsApp line is constantly abuzz as old fans of the Hot brand transition with us and new listeners share their delight at being able to enjoy our brand.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/619142.jpg" alt="Hot 102.7FM takes to the streets" width="950" height="396"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/619143.jpg" alt="Hot 102.7FM takes to the streets" width="950" height="404">
