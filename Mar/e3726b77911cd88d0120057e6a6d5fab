There is so much confusion surrounding such a powerful concept that marketers often miss out. So, in this blog post, we here at Engagement Factory will set the record straight on demand generation – and even point you in the right direction on five ways to get the most out of it.What is demand generation?Demand generation is the process for generating awareness and interest in a company’s products and services through marketing programmes, with the goal of increasing customers and revenue.What demand is not and not be confused with is:Lead generation - which is the signaling of consumer interest or an inquiry into products or services of a business.Inbound marketing - which is a technique for drawing customers to products and services via content marketing, social media marketing, search engine optimisation and branding.Demand generation is more like the umbrella term that encompasses lead generation and inbound marketing. So, as marketers, we need to view demand generation as the synergy that exists between sales and marketing teams, and how we move our potential customers through the funnel from MQLs and SQLs as a general business strategy, not as just a tactic specific to marketing.Demand generation can also be defined as a gradual, comprehensive, holistic approach to engagement that comprises dedicated inbound marketing tactics, social interactions, event-based campaigns (like webinars), always-on campaigns and more!Done properly, demand generation can create awareness around the issues most relevant to your business, provide sales the qualified leads it needs to close deals, and position marketing as a revenue generator instead of a cost center.What are the demand generation trends that can help you convert more from each campaign?Now that we have cleared that up, here are a few tips you can use to kick-start your own demand generation.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/600744.png" alt="Image from neilpatel.com" width="717" height="476" rel="">Image from neilpatel.comclick to enlarge1. Create awesome content for each stage of the customer journeySometimes this would mean giving away your best stuff! But don’t worry too much about that, because what you are trying to do is build trust with your prospects. This way, they will recommend and pass on your content as useful to other people in the industry spreading awareness. By offering something of real value, the prospect is also more receptive towards engaging in communication with you, as they’ll see you as an expert. In a way, this is one of the most effective ways of generation demand.2. Prioritise social media marketing and advertisingSocial media is a gold mine for demand generation.As an example, if you are in the B2B space, you should take advantage of what LinkedIn has to offer.LinkedIn has evolved from just a professional networking site to a lead generation, content sharing platform. More and more B2B marketers are investing their advertising budgets on LinkedIn.Some of the benefits of advertising on LinkedIn include: Access a tremendous audience Target your audience with accuracy Customise your budget to your business Connect with individuals in your target audience directly Support your account-based marketing campaigns Create a variety of ads, from video to textThis does not mean neglecting other social networks, just that you should know what works best for your own audience.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/600747.jpg" alt="5 demand generation trends for more customers" width="950" height="540">3. Try out video marketingAudiences expect video to be part of their digital experiences. Videos are fast replacing text and image-driven content across marketing campaigns. Information on video is easy to process, allowing you to drive your point across to your potential users. In fact, marketers who use video grow revenue 49% faster than non-video users.4. Optimise your email marketing strategiesEmail marketing best practices still apply, even in a demand generation campaign:Proper segmentation ensures followers only receive relevant messages and helps boost open ratesPersonalising a subject line can also increase your email open ratesConstant A/B testing of different emails helps determine which tactics are most effective and refine your campaigns accordinglyMost importantly, don’t flood inboxes with low value offers5.

This means that you must provide a positive experience to the site visitor through your website. Your website is the best opportunity for you to convince visitors about your product/service. If your website isn’t constantly optimised for the user’s changing needs, you are missing out on large opportunities for your business.
