Tell us about how you ended up in advertising.I attended an art school in Pretoria called Pro Arte which heightened my desire to work in the arts. I wanted a way to participate in the commercial world, but to also express my creativity. I then applied to Vega having heard about it from a friend. Vega really opened doors for me through their programme that placed students in agencies for an internship. The rest is pretty much history, all I needed was one foot in the agency door and the ad bug bit me..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} What do you love most about your work?I love the ability to see an idea come to life and impact millions of people in our country. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} You were appointed to be a judge on the Cannes Lions Print & Publishing jury, could you tell us about that experience?The experience was invaluable, a school of sorts.

One of my favourite pieces of work is a campaign called Nothing To Hide for a brand called Yalu.
