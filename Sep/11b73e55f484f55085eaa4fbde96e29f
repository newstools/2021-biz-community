“We have a stellar jury this year to review our record number of entries,” says Eben Keun, Pendoring’s GM, “We have steadily increased entries since we took over management of the awards, while also working to drive them into a more inclusive and diverse space. This year, we have reached a new record high, which is indicative really of South Africa embracing and celebrating the use of our indigenous languages more and more in all communication.”#Newsmaker: Boniswa Pezisa joins Mediology as executive directorBy Evan-Lee Courie 10 Jun 2021The jury members are:	Sanele Ngubane – CD of Toasted Samish 	Ntando Msibi – senior copywriter, Joe Public United 	Vumile Mavumengwana – CD of VM DSGN 	Bonolo Modise – creative fixer and Creative Director 	Seth Beukes – senior AD, WPP Team Liquid 	Coenraad Grebe – CD, Halo 	Sunshine Shibambo – owner, Cheri Yase Kasi 	Sibusiso Sitole – CEO, The Odd Number 	Dillion Phiri – festival curator, Fak’ugesi / Tshimologong Precinct 	Jabulani Sigege – ECD,  Wunderman Thompson 	Richardt Strydom – digital brand custodian Manager, Black Khaki Brand Communicators 	Terry McKenna – ECD, The Odd Number 	Lilian van der Merwe – CD, Independent	Khuthala Gala Holten – co-MD, Joe Public United 	Tumi Sethebe – ECD, The Riverbed Agency     	Tshepo Tumahole – copywriter, Joe Public United 	Tshepo Mogorosi – creative group head, Joe Public United 	Justice Mukheli – film director, Romance Films 	Mpumi Ngwenya – Founder / CD, 88 Eleven Concepts 	Lufuno Mavhungu – CD, Independent 	Simone Bosman – founder, OsuCreative 	Tshegofatso Phetlhe – CD, VMLY&R Pendoring’s campaign this year focuses on the importance of developing multilingualism in society. In a country where more than 91% of South Africans have an indigenous mother tongue, mono-culture strips us of our dignity and rich cultural resources in favour of internationalisation. The female-led campaign by Think Creative Africa and visual artist Lady Skollie makes a bold call for our mother tongues and for multilingualism to be applied at all levels of society, from early childhood development to the corporate environment. This is underpinned by the global UN Decade of Indigenous Languages that kicks off in 2022.
