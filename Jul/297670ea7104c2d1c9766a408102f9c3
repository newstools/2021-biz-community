Businesses that understand the power of art to the mind, heart and the bottom-line collaborate with creatives and through their work champion change, social cohesion, growth and well-being. Since its inception, the Basa Awards have recognised and celebrated these impactful business and art collaborations,” says Basa chairperson Charmaine Soobramoney. “Across seven categories and a Special Award, the 2021 Basa Awards once again highlight the many ways in which business and the creative sector have successfully collaborated despite the challenges presented by the pandemic this past year,” she adds.According to Basa CEO, Ashraf Johaardien, the theme for this year, ‘Rise,’ is both a celebration and a call to action. “Inspired by the great Maya Angelou poem ‘Still I Rise’, we felt it was important to acknowledge, augment and amplify the resilience of the arts sector and the business partnerships that have helped them endure; a quality that is reflected in the reimagining of content and context found in the projects and very determination of the projects chosen,” he explains.“The recent turmoil in South Africa has fortunately also brought with it a beautiful demonstration of the resilience that comes from a true sense of community. It is this sense of community, this acknowledgement that we are all in this together, this idea that we can be better together, that gives us the power to rise above any challenge we face as a society. The Basa Awards are a celebration of this ability to transcend and embrace a better future and we look forward to recognising the businesses, artists and art organisations who make this possible,” says Heidi Brauer, Hollard’s chief marketing officer.   There are 20 finalists in the seven awards categories, as follows:The Community Development Award recognises support for arts and culture projects enhancing their communities, whether through education, skills development, contributing to livelihoods or employment, tourism or other growth opportunities in the community.
