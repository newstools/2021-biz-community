The aim of Shift is to amplify, support and ultimately help secure jobs for new creative talent. This year’s programme comes at a crucial moment as the next generation continues to face significant barriers to education and employment in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic alongside rising racial and gender pay gaps. At a time when the industry must examine its existing prejudice and prioritise structurally inclusive hiring, Shift enables creative organisations and businesses to tap into a fresh, rich mix of talent outside of the college system.

This new partnership has enabled D&AD to launch digital training that aims to democratise access to learning, as well as facilitate the introduction of specialist modules into the curriculum in advertising, digital design, graphic design and production.  Paul Drake, foundation director at D&AD, said, “It’s time we look towards a fairer future for the creative industries. Creativity thrives from diverse minds and perspectives, and the only way this can be harnessed is by agencies and brands looking beyond those who have privileged access routes to get in. We all need to act on the belief that great creative talent does not only reside in a few universities or colleges. D&AD Shift with Google has consistently matched creative talent with professional opportunities over the past five years. With the continued support of our partners such as Google and Adidas, the programme is expanding and connecting a growing wave of self-made creative talent to the industry.” The 2021 D&AD Shift with Google New York program is now open for applications.
