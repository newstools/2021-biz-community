This year also saw the introduction of some new categories, reflecting rapid innovation and consumer technology adoption: Coolest online store, Coolest technology brand, Coolest digital learning platform, and Coolest fitness device.“The adoption of technology during the Covid lockdown has been phenomenal, and this clearly drove the need for more market intelligence in the youth sector.
