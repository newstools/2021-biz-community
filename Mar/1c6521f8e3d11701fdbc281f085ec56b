The partnership will see six local films funded, categorised into two streams: four feature films, by emerging filmmakers, with a budget of R4m each and two fictional feature films, by established filmmakers, with a budget of R6m each. The funding for the films will alleviate the pressure filmmakers face to raise additional funding and boost recovery of the creative industry from the pandemic, whilst ensuring job creation. All six films created from this fund will premiere on Netflix first.We are excited as the NFVF to be partnering with Netflix and appreciate their investment into local content. The incorporation of digital platforms into our traditional processes can only benefit the industry further. We hope this is simply the start in what will no doubt be a long and fruitful relationship,” comments NFVF CEO Makhosazana Khanyile.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/600793-120x120.jpg?2" alt="New fund launches to support screen sector workers affected by the pandemic" width="120" height="120">New fund launches to support screen sector workers affected by the pandemicA number of donors have contributed towards a support fund established to provide direct financial relief for screen sector workers whose livelihoods are affected by the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown...11 Mar 2021“The past year has been incredibly difficult with the pandemic hitting so many industries around the world.
