The economic uncertainty of 2020 and 2021 has been extremely difficult for most and we recognise that many small businesses have had to adapt, pivot and fundamentally review their purpose, business models and value propositions. Launching Female Foundry 2021 in conjunction with National Women’s Month is perfect timing for us as we walk the talk on seeing more women thrive in business.”Established to bridge the gap in gender parity – especially in emerging markets – Female Foundry offers experienced training and mentorship to empower and develop the skills of female entrepreneurs.In 2019, Hear Her Voice Africa was released, the catalyst for Female Foundry’s inception. The research paper took a deep look at how women in emerging markets are leveraging technological advancements to advance their businesses and sheds light on the challenges faced by female entrepreneurs in these markets across sectors. Initially developed by iProspect Singapore in 2017, the Female Foundry programme has since been launched in India, Mexico, Chile, United States, Canada and Russia. South Africa became the fifth market to launch the Female Foundry programme in 2019 when 15 local female entrepreneurs became the first cohort to graduate from the global, business growth programme. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/532930.jpg" alt="Dentsu Aegis Network South Africa host successful three-day bootcamp in Johannesburg for 15 female entrepreneurs" width="120" height="120">Dentsu Aegis Network South Africa host successful three-day bootcamp in Johannesburg for 15 female entrepreneursFifteen local female entrepreneurs have become the first cohort to graduate from Dentsu Aegis Network South Africa's Female Foundry business growth programme...Issued by Dentsu 20 Dec 2019Commenting on the 2019 bootcamp, Lelo Ndzimela, managing director at Hot Head Media, said: “It is such an honour to have been a part of such a great and empowering movement. I took home a lot of lessons from the workshop, which I still apply to my business. The best part of it all, is that I gained a great network of fellow female entrepreneurs that I can tap into.”“Female Foundry is an amazing experience that allows you to look at your business goals proactively and from a different angle with mentors that have your best interest in mind. Gaining business opportunities and friends in the process was a bonus,” says Maxine Mckelvey-Brown, former 2019 Female Founder and owner of Maximillion Digital.At Dentsu, we are committed to mentoring entrepreneurs and change makers to empower and accelerate their growth as part of our social impact strategy.
