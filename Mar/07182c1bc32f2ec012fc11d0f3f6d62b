Borderless Access helps our clients to retain their competitive edge in an ever-changing world.”Africa has typically been slower to embrace the digital revolution than the rest of the world has.

Globally, our hyper-niche digital panel community has grown from six million+ to seven million+, this year, with Africa comprising an important part of this.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/601545.png" alt="Borderless Access crosses more borders; launching first-party digital panels in Ecuador, Peru, France and Italy" width="726" height="408" rel="">click to enlargeDigital research helps businesses to retain their competitive edge Covid-19 has, of course,  changed the way the world works, enabling an increase of remote work, and flexibility of collaboration across continents.
