Everyone wanted a can, with their name on it. South Africa’s Share a Coke campaign went a step further, including a pronunciation guide below each name. “A first name is personal and unique. It is a person's identity, and when used in marketing campaigns, it shows customers that their brands of choice acknowledge them,” said Desirée Gullan, executive creative director of G&G Digital. Fast forward to 2021. Research proves that personalised emails have a higher click-through rate. When brands incorporate personalisation into their digital marketing strategies, they build stronger relationships with their customers, retain them for longer, encourage word-of-mouth referrals and create better experiences for new customers. "It’s important for brands to understand their audiences. We can no longer depend on demographics to inform marketing strategies. Customers want their brands to understand them beyond their gender, race and location. Personalised marketing that speaks to individuals with empathy will result in better engagement," Gullan added. A smart personalised marketing strategy will reap the following benefits for your brand.Better customer experience Customers will provide their personal information if they’re sure their data will be protected, and may participate in surveys, fill out forms and share their preferences.
