Digital is no longer new media .. it’s just an important player in the media ecosystem. As consumers consume more content online - this phenomenon will just experience more growth in those spaces. Particularly from a Connected TV perspective, as it affords us a bigger voice in the digital space and we look forward to partnering with brands on this digital first journey” Fahmeeda Cassim-Surtee, CEO DStv Media SalesCongratulations to all the winners and special thank you to our round table panellist, award partners and our media partners for the continuous support.
