Its Silver Pencil-winning campaign for the City Lodge Hotel Group’s weekend special, “Marital Bliss” champions the hotel as ‘your home away from work from home’. “All it took was three months of working from home to unravel three years of marital bliss.”  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/614136.jpg" alt="TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris Johannesburg's a winner once again at The One Show" width="900" height="900">Spotify’s “but make it Mzansi” (a merit award in the design category) asks: “How do you promote the world’s most popular listening platform in a country with some pretty unique listening occasions?” The answer – Spotify Premium, by “creating a vibrant world of distinctly South African colours, characters and stories”.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/614138.jpg" alt="TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris Johannesburg's a winner once again at The One Show" width="900" height="900">For the 1000 Women Trust, “Make Time”, which achieved a merit in the health, wellness and pharma category, says: “What girls learn tomorrow depends on what we teach boys today.”  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/614141.jpg" alt="TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris Johannesburg's a winner once again at The One Show" width="900" height="900">And Datsun Go’s “Clarity of Hindsight and “Carmageddon” both achieved merits in the radio and audio category, while the “Shhhh” campaign received a merit award in the Under 50k Budget category, demonstrating bang for a buck on a shoestring budget.   Pete Khoury, chief creative officer for TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris Johannesburg, says the agency is proud of their teams and delighted by the recognition because it proves their global competitiveness.  “Last month, we won two Wood Pencils for our client, the City Lodge Hotel Group. This time around our work for a range of diverse brands, in a range of different categories, was awarded,” Khoury says.   “For us as an agency it’s really good to pitch up in a lot of categories for a lot of different brands. It shows that we have diversity and impact in the range of work that we do.”  To compete on the international stage, on shows like The One Show, indicates TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris Johannesburg performs on a world-class level. It’s essential for agencies to be both locally relevant and globally competitive, Khoury says. “You have to keep pace with international agencies and even leapfrog them. If you don’t keep an eye on that, you can easily fall behind the times.”   Adding to this, CEO at TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris, Karabo Denalane, says: "Once again I’d like to congratulate all our clients, agency teams and all those who collaborated with us in creating these incredible bodies of work. For us, there’s no greater joy than to fly the South African flag at the world’s most prestigious award shows year in and year out. We hope that this work will inspire all those who see it and remind us that South Africa remains a world-class destination for creativity.
