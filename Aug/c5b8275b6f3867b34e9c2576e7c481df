Our team has worked hard on the car, and we’ve put in some good practice sessions. It all comes down to Friday’s practice sessions and then race day on Saturday. I intend to make Hot 102.7FM’s listeners exceptionally proud this weekend – especially the women.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/602551-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Hot 91.9FM drives Charisse in the 2021 Pozidrive VW Challenge" width="120" height="120">Hot 91.9FM drives Charisse in the 2021 Pozidrive VW ChallengeHot 91.9FM is proud to announce the sponsorship of racing driver Charisse van der Merwe as she embarks on the 2021 Pozidrive VW Challenge...Issued by Hot 102.7FM 25 Mar 2021Lloyd Madurai, MD of Hot 102.7FM, is excited for Van der Merwe’s races this weekend. “At Hot 102.7FM, we support strong-minded independent women and Charisse’s competitive spirit embodies our business ethic.
