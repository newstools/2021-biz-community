Tap as a Kovsie graduate, but then found myself in the advertising industry working on the ABSA small business, Scooters Pizza, and eventually the BMW South Africa brand. My love for premium car brands stems from their strategic competitive nature and my respect for their genius comes from how far they can look into the future and the why not -  it's fascinating!I then began my marketing career as a project manager for the MTN Group - for their flagship project the 20210 FIFA World Cup. It is here that my marketing career began to take shape as I got exposed to the best marketing minds on the continent as well as the Middle East. This is also where I began to see how a deliberate investment in career development and a care for people’s growth - could literally change lives. A ‘Can do’ attitude and the relentless pursuit to learn and become your best – was part and parcel of the tapestry and the culture of the team at the time. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2009/576305.jpg" alt="Momentum's Charlotte Nsubuga-Mukasa on her journey to success and the audacity to dream big!" width="120" height="120">Momentum's Charlotte Nsubuga-Mukasa on her journey to success and the audacity to dream big!Charlotte Nsubuga-Mukasa is the head of consumer brand marketing at Momentum Financial Services and is somewhat of a warrior who yields a powerful arsenal of passion, curiosity, ambition and a strong sense of community...Issued by MSports Marketing 17 Sep 2020.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How would you define your brand?Polished but progressive.

In order for our nation to reach its financial aspirations, the needs of women have to be tabled and actively pursued.

Research has shown that women shy away from boldly claiming their achievements for a number of socio psycho and economic reasons.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2010/580133.jpg" alt="Momentum #SheOwnsHerSuccess | Womentum Tribe Virtual Essay" width="120" height="120">Momentum #SheOwnsHerSuccess | Womentum Tribe Virtual EssayMomentum's #SheOwnsHerSuccess campaign is a celebration of the many inspiring women who have broken barriers and shattered stereotypes...Issued by M-Sports 13 Oct 2020In the month of August, Momentum creates their highly anticipated platform to empower women with networks, tools and resources to own their success with confidence.

Their lives are destined to meet and impact each other, but the story does have poignant points within the narrative, that manage to depict the reality of how our differences, can sometimes make us lose our momentum in fulfilling the potential that is already in us to become great. Until of course, one of the characters in the story takes the time to show us that our differences and uniqueness can actually be turned into a strength – with acknowledgement, advice and support.Matt the giant is a representation of our external challenges and our own internal insecurities. We all have moments where we feel awkward and struggle with a sense of belonging. Our insecurities and fears are what hold us back from achieving what we strive for.Alice is a feminine, strong, bold, down to earth, curious, intelligent Bohemian high-school teenager. In the story she is depicted as a polished young girl with an uncharacteristically beautiful red hair. She represents Momentum in the story as they solve and the adviser to her friend, Matt the Giant.  She may be young, but she is mature enough to notice the innate potential in Matt. Furthermore, she sees what others can’t see and where others see Matt as awkward and somewhat unusual, she finds him interesting and observes his life as it unfolds throughout primary and high school.She helps Matt discover his magic i.e. his “superpower” (when she intervenes and gives him a pop-up book which depicts a shared school play experience). This intervention then makes him realize that with the right advice that his momentum can be unstoppable. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us about your most successful marketing campaignMomentum has showcased its commitment to women through various platforms such as its sponsorship of the Momentum Proteas Women and the gSport Awards; a specific focus on understanding women’s financial success barriers through the Momentum Unisa Household Financial Wellness Index which inspired the Science of Success Festival; is injecting over R1 million into five woman-led businesses as part of the Budget Speech campaign for two consecutive years in a row.#SheOwnsHerSuccess is another way that Momentum continues to create enabling environments that propel women forward, encourages them to boldly claim their success and shatter the barriers to success.
