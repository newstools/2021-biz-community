It’s just another way that we make it ridiculously easy to stay up-to-date with who’s doing the best work in the country. Best in Craft (Direction) was awarded to Talya Galasko from Sketchbook Studios for Hope Guardians ‘Voicenote’.‘I think, getting such an intimate performance that conjures up so much emotion, utilising very little other than the performance to tell the story makes the direction craft on this piece a winner for me. The direction is so subtle yet takes the viewer on a journey of anxiety that feels so real and experiential. I particularly love the way the director creates tension in the film, through performance, intimate camera language, sound, silence and pace. Subtle performance notes like breath, movement and playing with the real and the imagined world heighten the sense of what mental health illnesses feel like. The story is simple and doesn’t try too hard to spoon-feed the audience, the director allows the viewer’s natural intuition to fill in the gaps around mental health. Mostly I love the way the direction of this piece makes you feel like you are not alone.’ says Megan Perks, ECD at Joe Public United.Best in Craft (Direction) was awarded to Kyle Lewis from Egg Films for Toya Delazy's Resurrection music video.Kyle Lewis - Toya Delazy - RESURRECTION from Egg Films on Vimeo.‘This film is quite literally an assault on the senses, but in all the right ways. At times I didn’t know whether I was dreaming, hallucinating or watching a music video. Kyle takes us on a journey into the spiritual underworld completely in harmony with the music. I know as a judge we try to not get swayed by other crafts like music production and art direction, but when all these elements come together as they do here it creates art and for many moments in this piece, I completely lost touch with reality, which is what art should do.’ says Adam Howard, owner, composer and engineer at Howard Audio.Find out more about the IDIDTHAT Craft Awards
