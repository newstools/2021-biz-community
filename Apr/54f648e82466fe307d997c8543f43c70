After I qualified, I backpacked through Europe and Asia for almost two years by myself and realised that I have a passion for human behaviour and understanding what makes people tick and behave the way they do, especially when it comes to brands. So, when I returned to SA, I decided to do an honours degree in brand strategy and management, and the rest is history.

One of my key areas of competence is in Financial Services, from my days at TBWA to now, I think I have consulted to over 20 banking brands in South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria in varying degrees.  My love for branding across Africa started at Enterprise IG where I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity to work on some of the continent’s biggest brands across both FMCG and financial services in both East and West Africa. I developed a particular speciality for financial services brands which was strengthened when I got to TBWA. I was part of the team that repositioned and relaunched Standard bank across the continent, which was an incredible experience and learning journey. I was also part of team that developed The Trillion Dollar Campaign for The Zimbabwean, which I think is still one of the most awarded campaigns of all time. More recently I have had the opportunity to work with MTN, developing and launching the Fibre to the home proposition in 2018, as well as some of our more recently and current clients like The Mpact Group, Investec, Remade Recycling and Internationally with IG.com. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any career highlights you’d like to share.Managing the Standard Bank account across 33 markets.Building the strategic planning team up from 2 to 12 people.Developing a core strategic digital competency into the business.Being part of the management team that took the agency from number 21 to being the number 1 creative agency in South Africa and number 5 in the world.Successfully managing the communication strategies for the majority of the Tiger Brands portfolio which include Ace, Tastic, All Gold, Black Cat, Jeyes and Do to name a few.

I think most clients found themselves in very similar situations where they were dealing with other internal financial pressures and marketing and brand took a back seat for a while which inevitably has a knock-on effect. But I think we can all see the light at the end of the tunnel now. Liquorish Ink was recently entrusted with the development of the brand proposition and corporate identity of eatery and wine bar brand, Proud Mary. Tell us more about this, how you went about creating the brand and the rationale behind it?This really was a special project for us, working with the team at proud Mary was amazing and watching this brand come to life has been really rewarding. The project started just before Covid last year and as you can imagine lockdown added a significant amount of stress and pressure to the process.The team wanted a brand that would become the heart and soul of the foodie scene in Johannesburg. What was key was that it had the comfort of familiarity mixed with just the right amount of nostalgic old school charm and modern-day fresh sophistication. A place that transcended as the hours go by and feed into the hustle and bustle of the neighbourhood. But most importantly it needed to be that place, where friends become family, where business feels like pleasure and every experience is remembered.To bring this to life, we created a positioning based around where the past meets the present. A combination of mid-century and contemporary elements..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you working on at the moment?We are currently working on some really exciting international project with IC.com a global online trading platform across their global markets.
