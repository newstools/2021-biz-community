The collection, called Standard Bank Presents, will give audiences across the country a taste of what the festival has to offer from 17 June to 4 July 2021. Says National Arts Festival CEO, Monica Newton:The National Arts Festival has adapted its festival experience to bring the arts to audiences where they are and at a time when we still need to be very careful about where we go and what we do to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.The gathering of artists is an important catalyst to reignite the industry and the festival remains committed to presenting the best and safest possible space for artists and audiences to come together, experience and appreciate the arts. “We are curating a tighter, more intimate festival in Makhanda and we do have to work very carefully around the Covid protocols, but we think it will be an opportunity to feel the pulse of a Covid-impacted arts world and to hear artists speak from live stages. We invite audiences to come and share this important moment with us.” The National Arts Festival Experience is coming!

We chatted to National Arts Festival CEO Monica Newton to find out how exactly this new virtual format will play out, the opportunities of targeting a wider audience and how creatives can try and combat the negative effects of the Covid-19 crisis...By Ruth Cooper 31 Mar 2020From Makhanda to the rest of the nation The National Arts Festival’s decision to present work in other cities was founded on the realisation that some audiences may not be willing or able to travel far and that many artists would struggle to afford the costs of travel to Makhanda as a result of the impact of the pandemic. “Our new showcase, Standard Bank Presents will give people a taste of the National Arts Festival and a window into what our artists are thinking and doing. As we adapt to our ever-shifting Covid reality, we need to try new things and imagine new ways for the arts to speak to audiences,” says Newton.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/608682.png" alt="The Rebirth of Iqawe, one of the shows at the 2020 Virtual National Arts Festival" width="800" height="500">The Rebirth of Iqawe, one of the shows at the 2020 Virtual National Arts FestivalNewton said the festival was realistic about the capacity of audiences and artists to travel to the festival in Makhanda but pointed out that the festival’s Eastern Cape visitors accounted for 55 % of their pre-Covid attendance figures in 2019*. This points to the likelihood of the live event in Makhanda largely attracting day-trippers and weekenders and, of course, the super fans; the ardent group of festival-goers who have already signalled their intention to support the live performances, no matter where they are.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2101/592143-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#BizTrends2021: 7 prospects and necessary shifts for the arts" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2021: 7 prospects and necessary shifts for the artsAll disciplines in the arts are undergoing big transformations.
