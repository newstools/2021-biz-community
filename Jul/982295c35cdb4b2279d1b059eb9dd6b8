Updated branding includes – amongst other things – a new logo and colour palette, which have been rolled out across the business.Supporting journeys to natural well-beingThe new Wellness Warehouse store concept was inspired by nature and a sense of locality. "Using nature as our guide, we have fine-tuned our aesthetics to express our core mission and value of empowering personal journeys to natural well-being," Kate Aitken, marketing manager of Wellness Warehouse told Bizcommunity.Aitken said that Wellness focused on how it could further support its customers on this journey, by creating stores that are designed to meet a range of unique needs, with a team on hand to help shoppers connect and consume more consciously. She explained that the store layout was re-engineered with core shopper needs and journeys in mind - from basic replenishment to individual consulting. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/616006.jpg" alt="Source: Supplied" width="600" height="531">Source: SuppliedInterior design and displayThe refreshed store design incorporates more rounded edges throughout to soften the space, with all-natural wooden finishes and granite tops to elevate the feel of the store, and texture to create interest. Sustainable materials were used wherever possible, said Aitken.Factored into the redesign was the desire to deliver an increased feeling of space and breathability for customers moving through the stores. And to deliver a multi-sensory experience, the air inside the store is infused with the retailer's signature scent, the Wellness Balance Essential Oil, and experiential zones have been added in which customers can fully engage with the products."Our ‘Inspire Tables’ showcase carefully curated products across categories to encourage customers to see wellness for what it is – a truly holistic experience that goes beyond what we eat or how we move. Where possible, we have displayed key ingredients that speak to what sets our products apart." <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/616007.jpg" alt="Source: Supplied" width="600" height="400">Source: SuppliedThe new store design and customer experience will be rolled out to all new Wellness stores going forward.Aitken said, "At its core, our transformation has been inspired by our mission to create a brand and space that truly reflects who we are at our core, facilitating a connection between mind and body in one seamless holistic experience. Inspired by a reverence for nature and locality, our new brand and store design honours our deep connection to the natural environment, while supporting physical, emotional and mental well-being for all who inhabit it."<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/615760-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Inside Sandton's new luxury beauty destination Arc" width="120" height="120">Inside Sandton's new luxury beauty destination ArcA newcomer to the beauty retail landscape, Arc launched online in April this year and is now branching out into physical retail...23 Jun 2021Wellness Warehouse CEO Simon Alston commented, “We are thrilled to launch our new store concept, which represents the culmination of our partnership with local brand agency, International Trend Institute.
