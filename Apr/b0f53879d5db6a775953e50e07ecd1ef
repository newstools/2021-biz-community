We thank them for their contributions and wish them the very best in all their future endeavors.“I have had incredible adventures during my four years at Kaya FM, far longer than the original two-year contract. I leave with fond memories. I am excited to embark on new adventures in media as technology broadens its horizons”. – David O’Sullivan“It was a sojourn back home that was filled with special moments. I wish the very best to the incoming team who I am certain will maintain the essence and heart of Kaya and take it to greater heights.”- Thabiso Sikwane“The Kaya family welcomed me with open arms! Even though this was my first adventure in radio, the team embraced me and my style. I’d like to thank the listeners, we really felt like a family. Salute and Aweh.” – Jason Goliath.On 3 May, we will be welcoming Thomas Msengana, who listeners will be familiar with, back home to Kaya FM. Good Friday host Skhumba Hlophe will join Thomas, and both will host Thomas and Skhumba in the Morning, Monday-Fridays, between 6-9am. We wish Thomas and Skhumba the very best and hope to work with them to take Kaya to greater heights.
