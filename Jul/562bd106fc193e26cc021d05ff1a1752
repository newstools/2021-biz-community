From the polo shirt, Oxford button-down shirt and bandeau top, to the pin-stripe blazer and double-bridged sunglasses, each style was inspired by a signature piece from the Tommy Hilfiger archive and reimagined to respect multiple gender expressions. Features such as widened shoulders and adaptable silhouettes aim to encourage continuous self-expression, fluidity and exploration. The capsule also tells Moore’s personal story, with details like their initials in collegiate font, their hometown of the Bronx, New York spelled across the chest, and a lotus flower graphic running throughout, symbolizing rebirth, growth and self-actualisation.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/621253.jpg" alt="Source: Supplied" width="600" height="455">Source: Supplied“This capsule goes beyond great style,” said Moore. “It breaks a cycle and sets a new standard across the industry. Too many people are made to feel that something is wrong with them just for being themselves. It means everything to me to know that with our capsule, no one is made to feel wrong or different or broken. Everyone works perfectly for this collection, no matter who they are.”SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/614144-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#YouthMatters: Tristan Shaun Henry celebrates queer youth culture through fashion" width="120" height="120">#YouthMatters: Tristan Shaun Henry celebrates queer youth culture through fashionTristan Shaun Henry is among the talented cohort of young designers forming Design Indaba's class of Emerging Creatives for 2021...By Lauren Hartzenberg 11 Jun 2021Campaign inspirationThe TommyXIndya campaign aligns with Tommy Hilfiger’s People’s Place Program ambition to create opportunity for creative talent from underrepresented BIPOC communities and increase visibility to foster a diverse and inclusive community in front of, and behind the camera.
