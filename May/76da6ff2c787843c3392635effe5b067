This and other core data around staffing and agency culture will enable us to produce a Best Agency to Work for framework.”Deeper analysis to meet global conditionsMcDowell notes that current global conditions have given rise to the need for deeper analysis across the industry. “In response, this fourth edition of Agency Scope will not only see marketers evaluating agencies, but the agencies rating marketers and clients.“Within the strictest confidence, each subscribing agency will be able to identify others most likely to provide the toughest competition for them and use that information to up their game. Our post-interview analysis will provide a final report with analysis by agency profile, type of companies, stated verbatim from clients,” says McDowell. “Agency Scope’s executive summary of the report, highlighting key data trends data from the study, will enable subscribing agencies to conduct their own evaluation of other agencies in order to set benchmarks for their own services,” Vacchiano asserts.McDowell concludes that analysing and publishing Agency Scope fieldwork data will give rise to a SCOPEN Data Platform that enables subscribing agencies to tap into the data that they can use to set new benchmarks in this rapidly evolving industry.“We are extremely excited to keep our subscribers in the know, at a time when the only thing we know for sure is that we need to know more.”
