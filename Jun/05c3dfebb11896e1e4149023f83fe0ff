This is where social commerce comes to the fore. Consumers are supplied with comparative information about their imminent purchases in a click or a tap, eliminating the need to check other stores or competitor products. What’s more, studies by Hootsuite found that consumers trust social media more than brand websites for feedback on products and customer testimonials. Social commerce offers brands the opportunity to capitalise on this fast-growing behaviour. “Social commerce proves that consumers are not just influenced by social media, they trust it more than traditional online commerce,” said Desirée Gullan, executive creative director of G&G Digital. “As marketing professionals for B2C brands, you should include social commerce in your strategy or you’ll be ignoring a vast portion of your target audience and allowing them to walk past your store and not take a look.”  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/607136-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Advertising to a generation that blocks advertising" width="120" height="120">Advertising to a generation that blocks advertisingOne of the ways to break through the digital wall is by crafting a digital strategy that speaks to modern generations, while resonating with the needs of older generations...Issued by G&G Digital 28 Apr 2021How to harness social commerce² For years, brands have used social media as an awareness or education tool, now, social media has entered its ‘buy now’ phase, which inspires and empowers consumers to see, like and buy.
