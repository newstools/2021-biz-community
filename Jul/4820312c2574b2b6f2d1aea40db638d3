This jury of global marketing leaders will look for work that takes an innovative, bold stance and has the greatest positive impact on a brand and its bottom line.” He added that the honour is unique for The One Show in that all its other awards are given to the creative team, agency, or brand, whereas the CMO Pencil is presented to the individual responsible for recognising and shepherding great work to life.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/614124.jpg" alt="South Africa wins seven Pencils at The One Show 2021" width="120" height="120">South Africa wins seven Pencils at The One Show 2021Promise Johannesburg led the way of agencies in South Africa in The One Show 2021, as announced by The One Club for Creativity during the online global Creative Week 2021...11 Jun 2021The CMO Pencil is just one of the organisation's initiatives to address and recognise the fast-growing brand-side creative community.
