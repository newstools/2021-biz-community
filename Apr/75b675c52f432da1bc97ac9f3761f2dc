And no one felt more rocked by the invasion than Emily (Daisy Edgar-Jones), who discovered she may have her own strange personal connection to the aliens. Series two of War of the Worlds sees our characters left reeling by the possibility that the invaders could be human. A tense fight to take back the planet awaits them. For some, the sheer desperation to survive will lead them to contemplate sacrificing one of their own. Howard Overman commented: “It was always my intention in the first series of War of the Worlds that the intricacies of human relationships would be at its heart. Watching these complex characters brought to life by such a fantastic cast of actors was a joy, and it’s been a thrill returning to their stories for series two.”“The first season of War of the Worlds brought a uniquely thrilling and action-packed drama with deep human emotion to viewers across the continent, and was an instant hit,” said Evert van der Veer, vice president, media networks, The Walt Disney Company Africa. “We are excited to join fans in the continuation of this gritty sci-fi story, just as we are to add this season to the existing content roster of the boldest, brightest and most unexpected live action and animation, that can only be found on Fox.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/523080.jpg" alt="War of the Worlds to premiere this October on Fox" width="120" height="120">War of the Worlds to premiere this October on FoxA contemporary reimagining of H.G.
