<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/616689.jpg" alt="Consumer and mobility insights continue to fuel investment in outdoor" width="950" height="534">The JCDecaux marketing insights team has worked tirelessly to produce a comprehensive report titled The Mobility Tracker informing the industry about the operational traffic levels compared to the pre-lock-down period, in addition to different mobility restriction levels. The report considers the current mobility restrictions across environments. Mobility is complex and dynamic, requiring us to fuse various data sources, such as mobile audience data movement, social listening tools, GIS (geographic information system) data layers, vehicle tracking system and traffic index information, to mention a few. The objective is to analyse diverse geographical areas, aggregating changes in traffic across provinces, metros and the peri-urban regions. In addition, reviewing footfall and shopping behaviours linked to different mall types, airports and transport systems. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2008/572176.jpg" alt="Addressing the changing media landscape Citilites Amplified" width="120" height="120">Addressing the changing media landscape Citilites AmplifiedTo address the changing market needs, JCDecaux analysed one of the most sought-after and trusted media solutions in the market: Citilites...Issued by JCDecaux 24 Aug 2020We have witnessed many changes in consumer travel habits over the past year, impacting traffic congestion levels, frequency of travel, routing, transport mode and other factors. The latest mobility report confirms the traffic operation rate is currently tracking at 95%, representing a +3% uplift in movement. An encouraging contribution to the level of mobility is a 30% uplift in shopping and leisure movement. In comparison, workplace movement has experienced a significant increase – tracking higher than the baseline by +3%. A fascinating insight is that the mobility levels of the peri-urban consumer market have been least impacted, particularly when compared to metropolitan areas. Such insights can assist FMCG brands in planning their route to market or direct-to-consumer strategies and communication plans. Many companies and brands are tapping into the latest opportunities of mall advertising to achieve a variety of communication goals around points of purchase. A Business Insider SA article highlighted that SA consumers are spending at a brisk pace where "transactions in South Africa breached R1trn in March 2021, according to a report by Clearing House for the banking industry, BankServ Africa." Demonstrating the value traditional retail continues to deliver. Shopper footfall is now tracking at 90% compared to the baseline, a 7% uplift from April 2021. We continue to see an increase in shoppers across super-regional, regional and small-regional centres. The most significant lift was Gauteng and KwaZulu Natal, which showed that shopper levels were higher than the baseline period. Mall advertising offers brands an environment that delivers unique brand experiences to audiences at scale.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/599302-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Digitally connecting brands and customers on the path-to-purchase" width="120" height="120">Digitally connecting brands and customers on the path-to-purchaseJCDecaux Africa is proud to announce the expansion of our latest custom-designed full-motion digital mall screens, JCDecaux i-Vision, to our network...Issued by JCDecaux 2 Mar 2021The JCDecaux Airport sentiment tracker, a quantitative consumer research panel, which commenced in September 2020, was commissioned to understand consumer intent and attitude towards air travel. Since its inception, travel sentiment remains positive, supported by the roll-out of the vaccine and various travel restrictions being eased. Travel is a symbol of confidence, of life, returning to normality. Some highlights from the report are:Between 79% and 87% of travellers say they will travel within the next six monthsTravellers are more focused, more alert, more open to influenceThere is a strong opportunity to emotionally connect with travellers during a period of heightened emotionsThe JCDecaux Mobility report at Level 1 restrictions highlighted 1,77 million travellers for the month of April 2021 across eight Acsa (Airports Company South Africa) airports.
