I can confirm that this is an intensive task that tests the integrity and stability of the data, which is managed by the MRF research committee.” The data will be prepared for final release with the data tree going to the software bureaux beforehand. This will enable subscribers and their agencies access to the updated data. The exact release date will be confirmed at a later stage by the MRF. Conducting the researchData from Wave 1, which was taken from July to December 2020 was presented to subscribers on 18 March 2021 and to the broader industry on 25 March 2021.  Koster said, “We are exceptionally pleased that the results have been so well received and feedback from subscribers has all been very positive. I would also like to thank Plus94 Research for the sterling and professional work put in to complete, and the continuation of the Maps fieldwork.” MRF board chairperson, Virginia Hollis, said that conducting the research during a global pandemic was challenging, but that it would be interesting to see how consumer behaviour changed from the last wave of results. “Notwithstanding the hurdles Maps’s fieldwork faced during Covid, we and our subscribers are confident that this data will have a great impact in the daily planning and strategic focus of our marketers and agencies,” she said.  Using the researchCurrently the MRF is in the process of reviewing both the Maps face to face questionnaire and branded diary. The first six-month fieldwork period and data release has afforded the MRF the opportunity to gauge the performance of the questionnaire in the field, as well as the data that has resulted from it. These lessons will be applied to improve the Maps questionnaire. Maps subscribers were asked to send proposals of what changes they would like to see in the questionnaire, and excellent feedback was received. These proposals will be considered by the research committee over the next couple of weeks, and the questionnaire will be finalised for fieldwork starting on 1 July 2021.
