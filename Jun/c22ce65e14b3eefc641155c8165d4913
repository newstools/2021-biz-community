This included Hero Creative Management’s director and head photographer Neil Roberts, as well as a selection of powerhouse drag queens representing the different facets of the queer experience.“These creatives were identified as 'one-of-a-kinds' to bring more personal meaning to ‘Come As You Are’ with the aim of assisting our global efforts in creating further awareness for the LGBTQI+ community and emphasising creative expression, individuality and community!” explains Ally Petersen, Crocs SA marketing manager.The campaign features the likes of Manila von Teez, Tessa Cloete, SuffoK8, Sugar Lynch, Lady Pambo and Cheshire V.
