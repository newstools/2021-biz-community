As shoes represent very organic objects, made from flexible material that also look different on every person, it was a fun challenge to translate this into the Lego System in Play, which by nature is square and blocky. "Thanks to the Superstar team at Adidas Originals it’s been a super collaborative process with valuable insights shared about the art of shoemaking, and now we just look forward to seeing how fans will take to the model, customising it in their own unique and wonderful ways”. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/614833.jpg" alt="Source: Supplied" width="600" height="405">Source: SuppliedTo celebrate the launch, the Lego Group asked six inspiring and diverse creatives to customise their own version of the brick-built sneaker, and now invites all fans to do the same, uploading their personal expressions on social media using the hashtag #RebuiltByOriginals.
