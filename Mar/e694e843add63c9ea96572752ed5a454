Globally, e-commerce sales grew 27.6% to the tune of $4.280tn according to eMarketer. Although the report suggests that this will decline in 2021 due to traditional brick and mortar stores taking back some of the commercial activity, the e-commerce landscape has changed significantly.Here are some key checkpoints for e-tailers operating in the ‘infodemic’ world: Understanding your customer and meeting a need“Although the environment has become more ‘digital’, customer experience is still pivotal to e-tail success. Before looking at sales figures and forecasts, invest your time into understanding your customer.Just because a large portion of purchasing activity has moved online, people still want to be able to explore and connect with a brand in a way that meets a need. As an example, e-tailers the world over saw a significant increase in DIY and home maintenance sales.

The larger the scope the larger the bill so it is important to make sure that whatever tech investment you make now is scalable for the future. Businesses who are in the infancy stages of their technical back-end need to consider what the future of online retail as far as tech is concerned looks like. Building apps is imperative.

We all want to know what we ‘should’ be doing; which systems to run; which products to sell; but at the end of the day, who should be telling us this? Who should we be building our business around? And how do we find this out? By listening to the customer. Listen to what they are looking for.

It is important that customers remain central to the core business objectives and the only way for this to happen is for the entire team to be part of the online fulfilment journey – from the social media channels, right through to the individual delivering the package.
