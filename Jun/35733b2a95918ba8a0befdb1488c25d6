There are approximately 1,200 Nando’s restaurants located across the globe from Washington DC to Dhaka, and each space showcases bold, bespoke furniture items which are procured through the Portal to Africa.As part of the Nando’s Design Programme, Clout SA has developed and facilitated one of South Africa’s top biennial design competitions, the Nando’s Hot Young Designer Talent Search, which has launched and supported dozens of local design careers, including Mash T. design founder, Thabiso Mjo, one of the first winners of the competition in 2016. In 2020, Mjo went on to become the first South African designer ever to have her work collected by the Louvre’s Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris, for their permanent collection.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2010/582124-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Musée des Arts Décoratifs adds SA designer's work to permanent collection" width="120" height="120">Musée des Arts Décoratifs adds SA designer's work to permanent collectionThabisa Mjo has become the first South African designer to have her work form part of the permanent collection at the renowned Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris...27 Oct 2020At its core, Clout SA specialises in creating interior solutions for hospitality, retail, residential and corporate clients – its approach foregrounds a South African design narrative as a point of distinction. For the next phase of the enterprise’s work towards growing the South African design industry and turning local design into a globally recognised category brand, Clout SA has invited corporate partners who share these values to join its mission by taking part in collaborations with its designer-maker partners. Clout SA x Hub collaborationAs part of Decorex’s month-long Cape Town Design Trail programme in June 2021, Clout SA will open an exhibition of South African art and design curated by Clout SA creative director Tracy Lee Lynch, titled 'Right here, Right Now!'. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/610520-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Decorex Africa to present inaugural Cape Town Design Trail in June" width="120" height="120">Decorex Africa to present inaugural Cape Town Design Trail in JuneDecorex Africa will present the inaugural Cape Town Design Trail in the Mother City from 1 to 30 June 2021.20 May 2021The exhibition will not only introduce Clout SA to the industry and invited members of the public, but also unveil a collaboration with Hub, a platform borne out of the Spier Arts Trust which has run the Spier Arts Academy since 2009, training artisans in the field of ceramics and mosaics, as well as supporting the development of visual artists.The Hub platform works to create collaborative commercial opportunities for artisans and artists. While this is the official public unveiling of the Clout SA x Hub collaboration, there are already some sterling examples of what the two organisations have achieved together. Previous Clout SA and Hub collaborative projects include the striking serving counter of the Nando’s restaurant in Soho, London. This features artwork by Hub artist Henk Serfontein, that was rendered in mosaics by Hub artisans. Another example is the Potjie Server by designer Thabisa Mjo. The beaded panels on the front of the server were designed by Mjo and created by the skilled Qaqambile beaders of Hub. The server was later featured as part of the Sacrosanct exhibition at Milan Design Week in 2019.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2010/580357-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nando's Hot Young Designer Talent Search 2020 finalists revealed" width="120" height="120">Nando's Hot Young Designer Talent Search 2020 finalists revealedFor the 2020 edition of HYD, young designers were asked to create a unique bench that responds sensitively to seating needs in a time of social distancing...13 Oct 2020 Invitation to trade professionalsAs part of the opening of Right here, Right Now!, from 21 June to 25 June 2021 at the home of Hub, the four-storey Union House building in Cape Town’s eastern district, Clout SA and Hub are inviting architectural and interior design professionals, corporate procurement agents and facilities managers, to join their mission to support, develop, invest in and build the future of South African design.
