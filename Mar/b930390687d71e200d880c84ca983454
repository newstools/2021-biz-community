The first mistake that I made is that I went into the business with debts that I had accumulated when I was working full-time; not thinking about the fact that I did not have a monthly salary any more to service those debts.Secondly, I did not know that I had to worry about complicated business stuff such as cashflow, overheads, company financials and administration, HR just to name a few. It all sounds very complicated neh? Yes, it was confusing for me too because I am a content person not into numbers or financials at all. Jack of all tradesThese are important things I had to learn because now I was a ‘one man show’ running all parts of the business on my own. In big organisations that I worked for, there were different departments that were responsible for various functions like HR, finance or legal issues. Now, all of a sudden, I did not have that kind of support in my business. I had to become a 'jack of all trades' and 'master of none' very fast. Just to clear the confusion and for any of you who have started running your own businesses to learn a few of the lessons I learnt. Cashflow is money that comes into the business regularly that is paid by your clients for a service or a product. This money allows you as a business owner to pay for the debts that I was referring to earlier or to cover any other monthly expenses (business/personal). Please note though that for you to have ‘cashflow’ – you need to have clients first that you provide a service or product to. And very importantly, these clients need to pay you regularly and on time – otherwise things will be bad for you and your business. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/600391.jpg" alt="How to manage cash flow during a crisis" width="120" height="120">How to manage cash flow during a crisisAndiswa Bata of FNB Business states that cash flow management is simply the discipline of managing the money coming in and out of your business to avoid liquidity shortfalls.10 Mar 2021I then learnt about ‘overheads’ – this is basically your business expenses, and these could be rent for an office space, stationery, airtime and data, the computer/laptop that you use for work, car expenses like petrol – just to give you a few examples. I learnt that it was very important to keep monthly expenses low; if I wanted my business to survive. It did not help that I was told by everyone that most black-owned, small businesses normally failed within the first two years. Just imagine how scared I was because I was not only black, but also a young woman. So, here the lesson I learnt was that I needed to cut any unnecessary expenses so that my business could survive on very small amounts of money. So, I did not get a fancy office to rent, I worked from my home  - on my sofa or bed with a laptop on my thighs, I realised that the only thing I really needed to service my clients was a laptop, a 3G Card/WIFI Router, airtime/data and a bit of stationery. So not having an office meant that if a client called me wanting something urgently while I am driving; I would stop on the side of the road, open my laptop, connect and send the document to the client. What was important for me was that work was moving - it did not matter if I worked from a boot of a car. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2003/542270.jpg" alt="#20Lessons20Years: Lesson 1: Am I really an entrepreneur?" width="120" height="120">#20Lessons20Years: Lesson 1: Am I really an entrepreneur?Over the past 20 years, Allon Raiz, CEO of Raizcorp, has learned many tough lessons and overcome many entrepreneurial challenges...By Allon Raiz 10 Mar 2020This at the end meant that I could get paid and make some money. So, my advice to those who still want to start their own business – try to go into a business that does not need a lot of money for you to be able to start – because this is usually money that most of us do not have. Lastly, I know that not all businesses are the same and our experiences might differ, so it is definitely not one size fits all. I am just merely telling my own story hoping that it will help a person or two.
