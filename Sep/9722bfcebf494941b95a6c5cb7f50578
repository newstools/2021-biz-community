The Union Swiss-Bio Oil brand community app designed by Bluegrass Digital was recognised under the brand platform and brand file category. The Instagram style app brings together a global community through features that allow users to upload media, contact fellow distributors, and view newsfeeds that display company news and community content. Upon receiving this award, Bluegrass Digital CEO Nick Durrant commented:"We are ecstatic to be recognised for the second time at the IAB Bookmarks Awards. We believe that the Bio Oil app is innovative in its ability to creatively connect Bio Oil’s distributors to one another. It was a pleasure working with the Bio Oil team on this project, and we are immensely proud of the Bluegrass team in producing this app. This award highlights our commitment to developing innovation and our purpose in continuing to drive excellence in all of our projects."
