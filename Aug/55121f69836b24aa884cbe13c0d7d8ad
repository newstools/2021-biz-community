We spoke to medical practitioners about herd immunity and also advocated that countries that have an abundance of vaccines to donate to other countries in the world, like South Africa..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} Why do you think campaigns like Vax Live are important?I think it's important for campaigns like Vax Live to exist because we need to keep having the conversation about vaccinations and their impact.

Basically any and everywhere. We are a large majority of society in the world, and the barring and barrier to entry of certain spaces means we are underrepresented - our needs are not being met as human beings. That is not sustainable for the world we live in now (which hasn't changed significantly, but some strides have been made)..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} What are the best means to give space for women to be part of this industry?Opportunities. Give us jobs, offer us a chance to pitch, fund our projects and businesses, promote us, share information with us, pay us what we ask for (not what you think we're worth). There is this notion that women need to be treated differently from what is being done for men - some needs might be different, but the basics are the same..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} What is the best advice someone has given you?I've received a lot of great advice that helps me out in different kinds of situations, but one that I've seen recently that stuck is "Do it scared".
