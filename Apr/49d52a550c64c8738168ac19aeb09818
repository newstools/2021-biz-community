We’ve weathered the storm to some extent and it is with great excitement that we formally announce the official call for entries for the very first Effie Awards programme on the continent. Winning an Effie, considered globally to be the most respected marketing effectiveness award, provides client-agency teams with global recognition for their most effective work. In trying times such as these, the value of that recognition could not be more pertinent for campaigns that delivered against a pre-defined set of marketing and business objectives,” says Mathe Okaba, CEO of the Association for Communication and Advertising.Entry deadlines for the 2021 Effie Awards South Africa are as follows:Early bird: Thursday, 10 June at 12pm On-time: Thursday, 24 June at 12pm Last minute:	Thursday, 15 July at 12pmRound one of judging will take place on Thursday, 12 August and the final round on Thursday, 2 September 2021 with the Grand Effie judging session scheduled for Monday, 11 October.
