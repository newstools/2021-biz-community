I intend to share what this means to me and weave in lessons from Jerry Maguire, which is one of my all-time faves.I selected this topic because leading with purpose is what we all need especially in this time of pain, loss and so much uncertainty. Empathy, humanity and seeing more than the performance metric is what has kept me and my team going. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you looking forward to with regard to the event?I have heard so many good things about the IMC. This will be my second one to attend, and I am looking forward to hearing from the fantastic speakers that are coming through. I think the range of topics and movies is going to make for some great content for all of us to learn from..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us about your role as group chief marketing officer: Momentum Metropolitan Holdings Limited?Aah, I really enjoy my role. I think selling insurance is harder than banking and FMCG. I am always challenging the team to find ways to inject emotion to an otherwise very cold category, and we are starting to see great results in brand health and other sentiment reports. My role also involves putting out fires as we deal with curveballs that come away through client complaints and other crisis matters. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/611604-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#BehindtheMask: Nedbank IMC speaker Mike Sharman" width="120" height="120">#BehindtheMask: Nedbank IMC speaker Mike SharmanMike Sharman is a serial entrepreneur, perhaps best known as the founder of Retroviral, which has made more brands go viral globally than any other agency in Africa.

Congratulations! What did this recognition mean to you?It was an incredible award for me. I am always striving to do work that makes impact. Getting this award affirmed that I am doing so successfully. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any key lessons you can share with aspiring marketers?I would say that marketing requires one to have a thick skin. Our work is always in public display (unlike Excel sheets that accountants work with). We take views, opinions and criticisms from our own peers as well as the public. It is tough to hear that your work is not hitting the right spot, or to be told that someone’s partner doesn’t like the ad.I would also say that you need to balance strategic thinking with creativity. We are going to operate in the “grey” for a while, so an entrepreneurial mindset is crucial for success. Make reality your friend in regard to shrinking budgets. I think more businesses will continue to cut spend, and marketing seems to always be the one that is “sacrificed”.  .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us more about your experience and/or any other career highlights to date.Leading a brand turnaround for Standard Bank.

We are a very connected team of marketers, and we thrive when we are in the office. So, we had to find a way to keep the energy going even as we work remotely. In terms of actual work, we had to interrogate our plans to be sure that we were doing the right stuff as the whole world shifted. Our agency partners have been amazing. They were quick to find ways to keep the fires burning and not lose momentum. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s really behind your mask - literally and figuratively speaking?A long-lasting lipstick that is a shade of red or plum.

My dad used to watch a lot of news and bought newspapers every weekend. So, I would imitate the newsreaders and pretend like I was delivering the news bulletin. What did you study, where did you expect your career to take you, and how does this measure up to your current reality?After matric, I initially registered for B.Com Accounting, intending to qualify as a Charted Accountant. After the first year, I knew that I had made the wrong choice. Following chatting to my mentor, I decided to study marketing, and I haven’t looked back since. I love my profession. When I look back at my CV, my heart smiles. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about the creative industry?The idea of using our creativity to solve problems or influence positive behaviour changes is amazing.
