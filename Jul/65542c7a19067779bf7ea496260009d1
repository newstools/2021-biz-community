Two key role highlights besides my current role have been when I was brand manager for Smirnoff Vodka as a young 23-year-old. I loved that role so much, I couldn't believe that they paid me to do it! Another highlight was running the skin category for Unilever for Africa Middle East and Turkey working from Dubai for three years. The combination of the very different markets, the fantastic brands (like Vaseline, Dove, Lux) and being on the global teams of these brands was just an incredible experience. One day I'd be in Jeddah discussing the growth of Lifebuoy whilst wearing an abaya, and the next I'd be in Nigeria looking at how we could make Vaseline a big brand in that market. No two days were ever the same, and of course, the bonus was the travel!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}You're particularly passionate about brands, especially brands that are purpose led, and that embody that purpose in everything that they do. Please elaborate.Brands have to play a broader societal role that makes a positive impact. It can't just be about your functional role, but a functional role linked to solving for some of societies challenges. That's what I love about heading up the Nedbank brand. Our impact goes beyond, yes, the important business of providing banking products and services for our clients, but we are also very clear that in order for us to be a sustainable business, we need to build a sustainable society through not only CSI, but in how we do business, and in the funding that we do..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Growing up, what did you want to be An astronaut - can you believe that?! A young black girl growing up in Swaziland wanted to be an astronaut. That's the audacity I've always had. Then I wanted to be a lawyer because I watched too much LA Law. I'm glad that didn't work out..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What did you study, where did you expect your career to take you, and how does this measure up to your current reality?I studied a B.Comm in Marketing and Information Systems from Wits. In my second year, as I sat down for my first marketing lecture with Professor Steve Burgess, I knew with absolute clarity that this is what I wanted to do. So being the group executive for marketing at Nedbank is exactly where I wanted to be. Heading up Corporate Affairs which includes CSI and transformation is an absolute cherry on top!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}When you're not busy working, what do you do? How do you socialise these days?Lots of reading. Lots of wine. Lots of online scrabble. Not enough running. Lots of series with my husband, Nelson. Thrown in with some physical connections with friends and family here and there..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you reading/listening to/watching at the moment?I generally read three books at a time. I’m currently reading The Twelve, the second novel in Justin Cronin’s The Passage trilogy; The Underground Girls of Kabul: In Search of a Hidden Resistance in Afghanistan by Jenny Nordberg; as well as So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love by Cal Newport.And I’m watching Barry (dark humour) as well as rewatching True Blood..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What's the first thing you plan to do when things go back to normal?Go on holiday. I miss travelling out of the country.
