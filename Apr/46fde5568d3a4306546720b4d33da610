Judging helps team members better understand the Effie experience from a judge’s point of view – particularly what made the stronger entries stand out, and what caused the weaker entries to score lower. Further to that, it’s also a great opportunity to network with industry peers and gain valuable insights into the industry and the work that delivers on effectiveness.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/605229-120x120.jpg?2" alt="2021 Effie Awards South Africa announces call for entries" width="120" height="120">2021 Effie Awards South Africa announces call for entriesThe Association for Communication and Advertising (ACA) has opened the call for entries for the 2021 Effie Awards South Africa...Issued by Association for Communication and Advertising 2 days agoJudging process By the time an Effie entry has reached the winners’ circle, it has survived at least two rounds of evaluation from a rigorous jury of senior industry executives focused on identifying the industry’s most effective work.The judging procedure is conducted in two rounds to select the most effective cases of the year.In each round, a jury of senior industry professionals from a variety of marketing disciplines evaluate entries based on proof that commercial communication was key to the success of the campaign.
