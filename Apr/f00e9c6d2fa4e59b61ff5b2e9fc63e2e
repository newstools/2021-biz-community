The launch of our stunt really had our consumers engaging and debating with us which is exactly what we had hoped for in the lead up to welcoming Comedy Month through what we believe will provide respite to consumers during a time of so much doom and gloom,” says Beatrice Marfleet, marketing manager of Jameson and Irish Whiskey.Public response to the prank has been largely positive on social media, however launching an April Fool's Day prank almost a full week before 1 April could encourage scepticism around valid news stories beyond April Fool's Day itself. Is this a responsible marketing approach in the fake news era?
