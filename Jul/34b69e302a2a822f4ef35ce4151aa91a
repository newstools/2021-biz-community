Despite making up 50% of the population and having 80% of spending power, women represent only 33% of business owners. Covid-19 has dealt a massive blow to femme-owned business with women-founded startups receiving 27% less funding. Similarly, women were a third more likely to work, or own a company, in a sector that was shut due to Covid-19 regulations last year. With the investment gap widening, small to medium owned femme businesses have become even more vulnerable.Fund Femme, created by global marketing communications agency, Wunderman Thompson, is designed to tip the scales and put balance back into the economy.Fund FemmeThe global platform allows consumers to discover, and shop from, women and non-binary business owners across beauty, fashion, food, homeware, technology, health and wellness, travel, fitness, arts and culture, media and charities.

By thinking more about who we support when we spend our money and changing our shopping habits to reflect this, we can create genuine, long-lasting change and bring our economy back into balance."To sign up and take part, go here.
