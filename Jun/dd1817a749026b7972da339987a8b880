And he knows what he is talking about. At Anheuser-Busch US, Marcondes leads the marketing strategy for some of the world’s largest beer brands, including Budweiser, Bud Light and Stella Artois. Whether he is delving into insights, innovations or consumer connections, people are at the centre of everything he does at the company. His people-first approach has led him to manage many of the fastest growing brands in the industry. Since 2018, the company has driven more than 50% of all the innovation volume in the beer category. Marcondes has an impressive list of professional achievements. A Forbes “World’s Most Influential CMO 2020”  and part of AdWeek’s top 50 across marketing, media and technology, he was also named one of Business Insider’s “25 Most Innovative CMOs in the World” for 2019 and 2020. Sports Business Journal included him in its “50 Most Influential People in Sports Business” for 2017 and 2018. During Marcondes’s time there, Anheuser-Busch won 17 Cannes Lions and 25 Clio Awards. He currently sits on the board of directors for the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) and is a member of the Cannes Lions CMO Growth Council. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2012/588113-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Marketing.
