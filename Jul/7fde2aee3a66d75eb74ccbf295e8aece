Once I am done with my degree, I would like to start my own agency to showcase creative talent and to tell people’s stories,” says Beyile. The importance of corporate-sponsored bursaries  According to a 2019 report by the SA government titled ‘Education Series Volume V: Higher Education and Skills in South Africa’, around 51% of the South African youth don’t have access to the financial means to pay their way through higher learning courses.  Additionally, according to Stats SA’s Quarterly Labour Force Survey (released on 1 June 2021), the official unemployment rate among the South African youth (15-34 years) was 46.3% in the first quarter of 2021. Not only does this highlight the current youth unemployment crisis in South Africa, but also the pressing need for bursaries in South Africa. Through additional corporate sponsorship, Red & Yellow can reach its full R7.5m target for bursaries and provide young South Africans with the opportunity to find success in their future.Corporate support helps to elevate the impact of the bursary sponsorship by ensuring that the funds develop highly employable students boasting future-focused and industry-relevant skill sets. Sponsors are also able to take advantage of significant B-BBEE benefits, which incentivise companies to contribute towards bursaries.  “Financial aid for students is pivotal as it enables them to transcend merely surviving in an incredibly difficult economy and to actively pursue their dreams,” says Meghan Slater, head of corporate sales. “Through Red & Yellow’s Bursary Programme, corporates can support the development of the local business landscape and increase employment opportunities by equipping bright young South Africans with the necessary skills to become the leaders of tomorrow.”Our focus at Red & Yellow is developing South Africa’s youth to meet the perpetually transforming demands of the future, regardless of their background or circumstances.
