The Unemployment Crisis among the South African Youth According to the Stats SA’s Quarter Labour Force Survey (released on 1 June 2021), the official unemployment rate among South African youth (15-34 years) was 46.3% in the first quarter of 2021. That equates to around 40% of individuals between the ages of 18-34. That’s almost half our youth that is currently sitting without work. Of that total, 52.4% are individuals that don’t yet hold a matric qualification, with a mere 9.4% being those who hold tertiary-level qualifications. Judging by the stats, it is clear that there is a direct correlation between education and employment.South Africa needs job creators According to the Annual Financial Statistics (AFS) 2019 survey, small businesses generate just a little over one-fifth of the South African formal sector’s total turnover. The formal sector generated R10.5 trillion, with small businesses being responsible for R2.3 trillion - 22% of the total. It is clear that the entrepreneurial spirit is high and acts as a critical driver of economic growth and job creation in South Africa. The youth will play a pivotal role in how the future of the South African business landscape plays out. Currently, the amount of jobseekers significantly dwarfs access to employment opportunities, and that's not a fact that will just magically change overnight. Future-focused education is the primary driver that will allow our youth to create a society that is free of unemployment. Technology is changing the way we live our lives and how businesses operate, and those changes are happening at a tremendous pace. That's why Red & Yellow’s curriculum has been designed to adapt to the needs of the evolving workforce. Our youth is well positioned to cultivate a business landscape that will provide great opportunities for economic growth. Their inherent aptitude for embracing emerging technologies and their youthful hunger for success are the perfect ingredients to thrive in a world that is in a constant state of rapid change. However, this generational benefit and raw talent need to be honed into industry-relevant expertise that can be leveraged in the business landscape to answer the demand of the perpetually transforming modern marketplace.
