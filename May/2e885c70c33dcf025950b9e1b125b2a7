Candidates which pass the assessment earn a verifiable certificate of their digital marketing expertise. About The Global Academic CouncilThe Global Academic Council consists of seven leading academics from South Africa, Portugal, USA, UAE, Lithuania, and Croatia. The role of the council is to establish a fair assessment, which in turn ensures the validity of it. This is done through quarterly reviews and adjustment of questions where necessary to ensure defined outcomes are achieved.  Rob Stokes, chairman of the DMAT, said, “The council is a crucial step in creating global credibility and ensuring the continuous enhancement of the assessment.” President of The DMAT, Steven Fine, expressed that bringing the academics together was not a simple task, but brought DMAT closer to achieving their overall mission of making digital education more accessible. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2005/556964-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Red &amp; Yellow offers free aptitude test to unemployed digital marketers" width="120" height="120">Red & Yellow offers free aptitude test to unemployed digital marketersTo assist South Africans affected by the coronavirus, Red & Yellow Creative School of Business is donating R2m worth of digital marketing certifications, specifically its Digital Marketing Aptitude Test (DMAT) to 1,000 unemployed South Africans that want to prove their worth in the job market...By Jessica Tennant 22 May 2020Cindy Cragg serves as academic director of the Communication Management programme at the University of Denver, and also functions as an assistant teaching professor at the university.
