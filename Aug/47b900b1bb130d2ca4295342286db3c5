The ability to deliver relatable entertainment, trusted news, and exciting brand experiences was made possible by our world-class team and their desire to show up for our listeners everyday, no matter what,” comments Deirdre King, Jacaranda FM managing director.Mzansi’s early risers couldn’t get enough as the Breakfast with Martin Bester team walked away with Best Commercial Breakfast Show and Best Content Producer award.  “We have the most dedicated team and we are all truly grateful to have such rich and rewarding jobs.  Given the year we’ve had – we’re extremely proud of our ability to connect with our listeners,” comments Martin Bester.Master conversationalist Rian van Heerden and his Afternoon Drive show team took home the Best Commercial Afternoon Drive Show. “The SA Radio Awards are a great indicator of listener love and we’re so honoured to be considered amongst the best. I’m immensely proud of the work our team does and especially of how we helped reframe some tough conversations in a tough year,” comments Van Heerden.The Best Commercial Station Community Project award went to the Breakfast with Martin Bester Show for the longstanding “Good Morning Angels” feature. The same team were nominated again in the same category for the various community projects showcased during the show not related to “Good Morning Angels”.“Two nominations in the same category is testament to how focused we are on showing up for our listeners. We’re the only radio station that has consistently showed up every week for the past 16 years through our Good Morning Angels feature – without ever skipping a single broadcast,” said Hennie Myburgh, Jacaranda FM programme manager. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/620628-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Mzansi helps Jacaranda FM raise R570,000 for Mandela Day" width="120" height="120">Mzansi helps Jacaranda FM raise R570,000 for Mandela DayOn 14 July, Jacaranda FM's Good Morning Angels set out to raise R300,000 for 10 children awaiting treatment at the Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital; the station reached the target within 90 minutes of launching the campaign but the donations kept streaming in...Issued by Jacaranda FM 26 Jul 2021The SA Radio Awards also presented Jacaranda FM with the Best Commercial Weekend Show award for Weekends with Kenzy.“We also want to congratulate Thulani Mashita on the bursary award and give special kudos to the Bright Star and Hall of Fame inductees,” adds Myburgh. To see a full list of the award winners, visit www.radioawards.co.zaAbout Jacaranda FM Jacaranda FM broadcasts at 94.2FM from Midrand, Gauteng and is one of the most popular radio stations with a substantial footprint across Mzansi.
