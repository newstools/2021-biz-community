This culture helped us to navigate the pandemic, so even though we weren’t physically together, we were still able to function as one team albeit a remote one. Right from the beginning, we focused on our communities and collaborated with the Kolisi Foundation and other NGOs to support the incredible work they were doing. In addition to this, we were aware of the long hours being put in by frontline workers, so we donated product to thousands of healthcare professionals to make their shifts a little more comfortable. Once the country was allowed to exercise again, we enhanced our virtual offering and encouraged people to stay active during Covid, and to look after their health and mental wellness.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/606589-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#BehindtheBrandManager: Nivea's marketing manager, Mpume Ngwenya" width="120" height="120">#BehindtheBrandManager: Nivea's marketing manager, Mpume NgwenyaMpume Ngwenya, marketing manager at Nivea, tells us about her career journey to marketing and about their latest 'Skinfluencer' campaign...By Jessica Tennant 22 Apr 2021.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}We love that Siya Kolisi is part of the new global Impossible is Nothing campaign. What are the qualities that Adidas looks for in its brand ambassadors/campaign partners and why was Kolisi a good fit for this particular campaign?Impossible is Nothing is more than a campaign – it’s our brand attitude. Seeing possibilities with optimism is key to achieving our purpose of changing lives through the power of sport. This attitude is what inspires us every day and is pushing us to build the future. Sport is an agent of possibilities. With a rebellious spirit and determination to drive change, we always strive to expand the limits of human possibilities, to include and unite people in sport, and to create a more sustainable world. We do this by seeing possibilities and inspiring with this attitude amongst our communities and beyond.  Who better to show the world how this is done than the trailblazers of sport and sport culture that have paved the way for tomorrow’s gamechangers to go further – those who inspire others to create a better tomorrow for themselves, their communities and the world.   Siya Kolisi, our first Black captain of the South African rugby team, saw the possibilities to lead his nation to victory at the 2019 World Cup, securing a win that stretched beyond the rugby pitch of Japan and touched the lives – and hearts – of all South Africans and people from around the globe. From humble beginnings in the townships of Port Elizabeth, to becoming a global icon, no one represents the possibilities of sport better than Siya. Siya’s childhood presented many challenges but he saw possibilities. He was raised with a strong sense of community and this feeling and value continues today, driving him forward to build a better life not only for himself but the community that raised him through the Kolisi Foundation. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What have been some of your favourite Adidas campaigns to work on, and why?The reintroduction of our brand attitude, Impossible Is Nothing is definitely my favourite of all time. For Adidas, Impossible is Nothing is an attitude, a way of shaping a better future with rebellious optimism, and seeing the world with possibilities where others only see the impossible. This has never been more important than now. Considering what the world is going through right now, we all need something to believe in and work towards. Impossible is Nothing features over 20 global partners such as Beyoncé, Mo Salah and our very own Siya Kolisi. Told in the documentary style of home footage, the series provides a previously unseen side to some of the most documented individuals in the world, enabled via a powerful narrative delivered by friends or fellow athletes, and animated via resurfaced footage from the archives. Featuring previously unseen intimate moments, it follows stories in sport and culture, showing how optimism and action has shaped their lives. Exploring the future they imagined for themselves and making it a reality, the series celebrates the trailblazers that have made history on a global stage. More importantly, it aims to inspire others, empowering them by this collection of very human stories as a powerful demonstration of what optimism can achieve. We have also had the privilege of featuring local talents such as fashion designer Thebe Magugu, national rugby player Zinhle Ndawonde, Paralympic athlete Anrune Weyers and our national football captain, Thulani Hlatshwayo..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What skills and qualities do you feel are key to being a successful brand custodian?•	Agility - this is an ever-changing environment and you need to be able to adapt quickly and effectively.•	Passion - for the brand and for people.
