Still observing the festival’s city-based concerns of urbanity and spatial politics, some of the artists on the programme consider how these concerns have been further exacerbated by the pandemic. There are also many works that celebrate resilience, spirit and community.For instance, acclaimed artist Wezile Mgibe will present a work aptly titled We regret to inform you that echoes these sentiments.The festival has been restructured to embrace a new social-distancing model that will allow it to go ahead within the current restrictions and concerning all health and safety protocols. Reimagined as a crowd-free event and taking place across multiple outdoor venues, (Un)Infecting the City also incorporates new digital and virtual elements that can be experienced by anyone with access to the internet and from anywhere, expanding the festival beyond the physical limits of Cape Town.Comprising eight distinct programmes, (Un)Infecting the City offers a wealth of culturally rich opportunities created by 50 different artists that are entirely free to the public. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2105/608031.png" alt="Public arts festival (Un)Infecting the City to take place May and June" width="4000" height="2250">Programme:Programme one will run from 7 to 8 May 2021 from 6.30pm onwards and is a series of videos screened on the sides of buildings within the CBD combined with performances.
