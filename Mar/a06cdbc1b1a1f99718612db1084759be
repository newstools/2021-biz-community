One controversial topic to be addressed, on 29 July 2021, is what to do when you are a brand in crisis. The global pandemic has resulted in the need for brands to be extra vigilant on social media. The perception that a brand is not portraying the appropriate levels of empathy is one of the key causes of brand criticism online. In South Africa, we have also seen crises rapidly escalating based on massively misjudged advertising. Failure to understand cultural context has resulted in public outrage and substantial reputational and financial damage. Inappropriate comments, product fails and employee errors are also a source of potential social media brand fallouts.Despite the danger of brands finding themselves in a social media firestorm, a HubSpot survey revealed that only 45% of marketers admit to having a documented crisis communications plan.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/601531.jpg" alt="Victor Dlamini" width="500" height="500">Victor Dlamini<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/601533.jpg" alt="Mike Stopforth" width="500" height="500">Mike StopforthNew social media crisis consultancy 48H, led by industry gurus, Victor Dlamini and Mike Stopforth, is bringing real-world solutions to clients in crisis or who wish to plan for or avoid a crisis. “We bridge the gap between traditional media and agencies and what the client really needs in times of crisis.
