In particular, Krawchuk will focus on building digital strategies and leading creative campaigns that connect APO Group’s customers with media all over Africa and beyond.Public relations in Africa is traditionally challenging. There are 54 individual countries with vastly different cultures and media landscapes. APO Group is in the unique position of being able to build a bridge between international business and this diverse African media community.   Not even the largest global PR agencies can match APO Group’s reach or depth of contacts in every African country. APO Group has a database of over 450,000 journalists and distributes more than eight million press release emails in Africa every month. In 2020, content distributed by APO Group appeared on more than a million online African news pages. Krawchuk brings huge experience in all areas of public relations and digital marketing, and she is excited by the prospect of working with the many multinational organisations who look to APO Group to establish and develop their presence in African markets. “Journalists in Africa know APO Group better than any PR or digital agency,” Krawchuk says. “But the opportunities for our clients go far beyond traditional PR and press release distribution. Our role is to make integrated communications in Africa easier for multinational companies and help them utilise the special relationship APO Group has with African media.” Born in Cape Town and residing in Johannesburg, Krawchuk has more than 20 years’ experience in PR and digital marketing. She has worked across the African continent and throughout Europe, spending much of her early career in the event management space in the UK. Over the last decade, she has worked in key leadership roles within the digital, public relations and traditional agency sectors.Krawchuk has developed strategic brand solutions for a number of award-winning agencies, notably TBWA Group and, most recently, Clockwork Media, where she worked as executive head of client service and was responsible for major accounts including BMW, Emirates, La Liga, Standard Bank, Exxaro, E! Entertainment, Oracle, Seacom and many others.Krawchuk’s experience with these major international companies will play an important role in promoting APO Group’s ongoing mission to change the narrative about Africa. “Brands prosper when they engage in continuous conversations with people in a relevant and meaningful way,” Krawchuk says. “At APO Group, we can make those conversations happen, building lasting relationships that open new doors for multinational organisations and generate positive stories about Africa that can be told all around the world. If the biggest companies are thriving in Africa, the whole continent benefits.” As well as working towards challenging international perceptions of Africa, Krawchuk is passionate about making a difference in people’s lives, with a particular interest in promoting equality and developing women leaders on the continent.  “Krawchuk is a perfect fit for this unique role within African PR and media relations,” says Nicolas Pompigne-Mognard (www.Pompigne-Mognard.com), founder and chairperson of APO Group. “APO Group is the only consultancy with the reputation and know-how to help multinational companies build integrated, digital media strategies across the whole of Africa. Lynne’s experience working with some of the biggest international brands will help our clients make even deeper connections with the African media. We are thrilled to welcome her to APO Group.” About APO Group: Founded in 2007, APO Group is the leading Pan-African communications consultancy and press release distribution service.
