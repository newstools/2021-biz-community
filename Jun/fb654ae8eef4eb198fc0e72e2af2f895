We’re looking forward to this Currie Cup season as the media sponsor, partner, supporter and sponsor of the Cheetahs. I think the team has a fantastic opportunity to reclaim the Currie Cup. They have a great squad, great backing and great leadership. We wish the team well,” concludes Efstathiou.Says Kobus le Roux, general manager commercial of the Toyota Cheetahs: “The Toyota Cheetahs are proud to have taken hands yet again with the Central Media Group, and specifically OFM. A proudly central South African company like OFM is now yet again the official media partner of the Toyota Cheetahs.
