Devilsdorp | Binge from 29 July  In 2016, a spate of brutal Appointment Murders gripped the town of Krugersdorp, leaving sales people and consultants terrified to book meetings in case they were the serial killer’s next victims. The investigation led detectives to a series of unsolved cold cases, the so-called Satanic Murders, and to links between 11 Krugersdorp killings between 2012 and 2016. They discovered these were the work of the Electus per Deus (Chosen by God) cult.“The result of an 18-month research process, Devilsdorp shows again that truth is stranger than fiction, especially in South Africa,” says director David Enright. "This is the story of the events that rocked an entire community and forever changed the lives of those involved, especially the families of the victims. What started as a group of devout Christians trying to help a former satanist escape the satanic church ended in a murderous spree involving a killer mom, her two children, and a cult with more victims than members. It may all sound too far-fetched to be believed, except it really happened - just down the road from us."<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/617613-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Devilsdorp: Showmax brings true crime closer to home with Krugersdorp Killings docu-series" width="120" height="120">Devilsdorp: Showmax brings true crime closer to home with Krugersdorp Killings docu-seriesHell comes closer to home in the first-look trailer for Devilsdorp, the first Showmax original true crime docu-series, which will be available to binge from 29 July 2021...Issued by Showmax 6 Jul 2021Alongside extraordinary footage of exorcisms, church meetings, and trial testimonies and judgments, Devilsdorp features first-hand accounts from the likes of Captain Ben Booysen, the senior investigating officer; deputy director of Public Prosecutions Gerrit Roberts; Discovery claims specialist Shane Chatzkelowitz; and journalist Marizka Coetzer.

But their relationship hasn’t always been a fairytale, with an incident of gender-based violence trending on social media in 2019. In Uthando Lodumo, West Ink Records founder Mampintsha is still dealing with the aftermath of that controversy, as his initial letter to Babes’s family is rejected, and Babes worries that his apology to her parents may not be enough to keep her family from turning Mampintsha’s family away at the gate. Produced and directed by Safta winner Thomas Gumede and Safta nominee Lungile Radu, Uthando Lodumo has held the number one position in the SA top 20 on Showmax since its launch. In their four star review, Drum called it “very personal and unfiltered.”   The Snail and The Whale | Binge nowIn June 2021, Annecy International Animation Festival awarded Cape Town company Triggerfish the Mifa Animation Industry Award.
