In a Front Row explainer video featuring Front Row alumni and industry leaders, Zanele Kabane of the IAB SA Youth Action Council explains why this is such a critical programme for driving change in the industry: “The IAB SA Front Row initiative empowers young black creatives who’re interested in making an impact by giving us access to information, connections, and the right tools. Without platforms like this, it’s a struggle to have our voices heard. The Front Row initiative not only gives us a seat at the table, it helps us create our own table for the future.”Paula Hulley, CEO of IAB South Africa: “It is vital that we are always increasing our engagement with the future leaders of our industry while bringing in a fresh, and different, perspective to the IAB SA as a whole. Platforms like the IAB SA Front Row and IAB SA Youth Action Council aim to provide easier access to information and platforms of engagement while creating valuable collaborative spaces and the opportunity to "sit at the table" with seasoned industry leaders at the highest level."Congratulations to all the winners and a special thank you to our round table panellists, award partners, and our media partners for their continuous support.
