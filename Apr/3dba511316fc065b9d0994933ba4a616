That is changing. At least 90% of consumers want brands to be clearer about how they use their data, and to give them more control over it. In January 2022, Google Chrome will no longer allow the tracking of third-party cookies, meaning brands will cease to have access to much of the data they currently use to target audiences and drive online sales. The impact of this on advertisers and publishers won’t be beneficial, however, there’s an upside for general internet users and consumers. Naturally, advertisers will see the third-party audience shrink, which will negatively affect media buying activities. At the same time, publishers will feel partnership disruptions with third-party data providers. Internet users, in general, will have more secure data privacy (GDPR/PoPIA), and consumers will have more control over data sharing.A total of 80% of consumers feel they cannot control the security and privacy of their personal data. And they would be right, an average user visiting news24.com will have their data shared 410 times in the first 15 seconds on the website. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1711/419905.jpg" alt="The ingenious Facebook trap: Is it time for ensnared brands to cut their losses?" width="120" height="120">The ingenious Facebook trap: Is it time for ensnared brands to cut their losses?Facebook was silently plotting increasingly creative ways to monetise brands' presence on the platform and implemented an ingenious strategy to ensnare unknowing brand custodians...By Ewoudt Cloete, Issued by Wunderman Thompson 22 Nov 2017Ambitious brands do not need to share their customers’ data.
