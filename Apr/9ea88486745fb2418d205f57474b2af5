I was bullied at school, so my parents encouraged me to become my own hero to build my confidence. When I became more confident, I automatically started inspiring other kids who were going through the same thing or issues that we linked to what I was going through. I encourage kids to become their own hero. My parents saw the need for this in South Africa and Africa and encouraged me to inspire children on a bigger scale. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}You've already inspired thousands through your work. What inspires you?I just really want to see fellow superhero’s achieve their goals and dreams. I want to see other children respect each other and help each other. I want to remove bullying from our schools and the minds of children. All of these goals inspire me. I am a Superhero and so are you.
