Thumping beats, drummers, dancers, flashing lights - all of these serve to take the attention away from the challenges we all face, and centre everyone in the moment.Boosting moraleAs far as internal company events go, entertainment has always been a way of bringing people together and boosting morale. Your staff have faced many challenges this past year. They’ve been stressed; some staff members may have succumbed to the coronavirus pandemic, and where so much has changed in your business and in their personal lives, for so many people, how you engage them matters even more now.Retaining attentionPeople have different attention spans, so the use of entertainment interspersed throughout the programme of a conference would bring people back to the matter at hand. It serves to shake off boredom, reignite passion and sharpen concentration.  Celebrating big movesMusic and dance as a method of celebration have allowed companies and their employees and stakeholders to mark the special occasions of their growth. New branch openings, mergers and acquisitions, targets met and exceeded - these have often been commemorated with entertainment.Even with these gatherings of people being hosted online, the motivation behind engaging people remains the same: you will still want to set the scene, boost morale, retain attention and celebrate big moves. People can still be influenced and emotions can still be triggered digitally. Music can still be incorporated into online events. Entertainment can still be used digitally to bring people together - even if they are in multiple locations.  This is because entertainment doesn’t just boost morale - it heals.
