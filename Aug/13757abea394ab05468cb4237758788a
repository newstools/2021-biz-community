The name change follows the 2018 majority acquisition of the former Chevron South Africa Pty (Ltd) by Glencore South Africa Oil Investments (Pty) Ltd, since which time Astron Energy has been operating the Caltex brand under a licence agreement. Astron Energy has now taken the opportunity to consolidate its operations under a single, unifying brand identity. The existing network of over 850 Caltex service stations in South Africa and Botswana will be rebranded in a phased manner as part of a refresh and upgrade initiative to be undertaken over the next few years. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/621168-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Isabel Dos Santos, daughter of Angola’s former president and Africa's richest woman, sits for a portrait during a Reuters interview in London, Britain, 9 January, 2020.
