The best part of this two-in-one solution is that the actual product is placed directly above the advertisement poster of the same product. This creates an immediate call-to-action for shoppers seated in the pharmacy waiting area.  “Queuing time is prime time for brands to capture the attention and make an impression on shoppers. An educational call-to-action is the most effective in this area where you have a captive audience with little else to do during their dwell time, increasing the opportunity to see the product and having it an arm’s reach away,” says Cecil Ungerer, chief sales officer at Smart Media.The double-sided poster not only educates and informs customers who are waiting in the queue, but also the healthcare professionals behind the dispensary counter.The high-quality fabric frame arches are strategically placed on every second queuing rail arch to create maximum brand exposure. The arches are guaranteed to increase brand and product exposure in-store.On average, there are four to five arches available in each of the stores, ideal for multiple brands to advertise or for a single brand to place multiple products.
