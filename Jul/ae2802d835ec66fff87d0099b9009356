In answer to this, TikTok has announced that rugby fans will be able to use the platform and show their support for the team using the #StrongerTogether tag.  TikTok has also announced that it is the official creator platform for The British & Irish Lions Tour to South Africa and that locals can catch up with all the action from both rugby teams directly from the platform. As part of the partnership, TikTok is hosting a series of Live's with the British & Irish Lions to take fans behind the scenes and bring everyone closer to the action. TikTok will also be giving fans the inside look at life on tour - from pre and post-match takeovers, interviews with the players, and an exclusive look at the team's training sessions.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/618014.png" alt="TikTok concludes first Rising Voices initiative" width="120" height="120">TikTok concludes first Rising Voices initiativeTikTok hosted its first-ever incubator programme, Rising Voices, which focused on supporting local content creators of colour through digital skills development and content amplification...By Emily Stander 8 Jul 2021 One of these Live’s takes place on 4 August at 11am.
