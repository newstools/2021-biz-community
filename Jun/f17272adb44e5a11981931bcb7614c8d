Subject to this scrutiny session we will be able to release the RAMS data at the end of July or beginning of August 2021.”The methodology will be structured into two parts - firstly, 3,000 CATI (Computer Aided Telephonic Interviews) will be conducted monthly (36,000 per year and nationally representative) providing audience measurement in 15-minute segments, along with audience tracking on radio events and roadshows. The programme will cover 280 stations (commercial, African language and community). Secondly, still to come and to track both linear and non-linear listening, a MediaCell Passive Listening Panel will measure linear broadcast and digital consumption of 4,000 panellists daily, with minute-by-minute tracking of activities.
