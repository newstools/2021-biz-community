The Youth Innovation Challenge (YIC) is Innovate Durban’s Flagship Programme and this year they have chosen to align the YIC to an overarching theme of ‘Responding to Crisis’ with a view to address some of the globally felt challenges that have become more relevant during the recent unrest and ongoing pandemic. Whilst these areas of need have continued to plague us; we have seen the devastating impact on resources, industries, logistics and communities which will be felt for a long way into the future. As such Innovate Durban have identified four of the UN Sustainable Development Goals that will be presented as challenges in local context.
