They become businesses of experience, setting experience in the boardroom as a CEO priority because it ties back to every aspect of a company’s operations. Research by Accenture highlights that 56% of COOs, 53% of chief strategy officers (CSOs) and 51% of chief financial officers (CFOs) said their company will fundamentally change the way it engages and interacts with its customers. A great experience is defined not by what you offer but by how well you enable your customers to achieve the outcomes most important to them. COVID-19 has so far changed the experience of being a customer, an employee and a citizen. People are turning to brands that provide security, and that they can trust in a time of uncertainty. “In a world of uncertainty, today’s leading brands are creating promises not only to shareholders but to customers, employees and societies. Promises of consequence that drive purposeful change for everyone. Experiences are where these promises are felt,” states Townsend. To meet the ever-increasing expectations of modern customers, companies must deliver always-on, immersive CX that shape and transform an individual’s entire path-to-purchase in real-time. “As innovators in this moment, we’ve got to ask ourselves: Are we improving everyday lives? Because anything less is wasted potential. We can do better; people deserve better,” states Townsend. “At Accenture Interactive, we connect deep human and business insights with the possibilities of technology to define and deliver new realities. It is time for brands to focus on experiences that can make lives easier, healthier, safer, more productive and rewarding,” he concludes.
