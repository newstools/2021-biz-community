The survey also revealed that more than half the respondents had previously entered the awards, and all indicated that they were satisfied with the online entry process. Aspects for improvement included feedback that there were too many categories, some entry categories were overly subscribed (e.g. social media) and there were suggestions around a potential Assegai Awards Hall of Fame. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2008/573746.png" alt="Agency credentials: So much more than swagger" width="120" height="120">Agency credentials: So much more than swaggerIt's the whole package - the attitude, the appearance, the swagger.

Several respondents also mentioned that they enjoyed watching the excitement of those behind the ads. As always, the networking opportunities afforded by the Assegai Awards evening came in for many mentions.
