Reaching over 75,000 users to-date, 12,000 of whom are in the 18-24 age category, the 2020 Annual has enabled the organisation to fulfil a core mission by reaching as wide an audience as possible, and inspiring and supporting emerging talent in new ways. 58th edition of D&AD Annual will be digital and free of charge2 Oct 2020The D&AD Annual has always served as a source of inspiration, education and celebration, and this year’s free digital publication goes a step further with new features and a content series that promotes two-way conversation between D&AD and the global industry.
