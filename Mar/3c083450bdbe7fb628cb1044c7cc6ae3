<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2103/602065.jpg" alt="Lit lineup for Basa Assembly" width="950" height="720">Billed as ‘not a conference, an un-conference, an indaba, a colloquium or a symposium’, Assembly is a hybrid of live and digital engagements across social, digital and media platforms launching on 24 March 2021 and open to the public from 25 March 2021.“Covid-19’s elimination of gatherings, festivals and other variations of close human interaction, has magnified the vulnerability of the arts sector and exposed a deep need for more sustainable models to support artistic and cultural activity in South Africa,” comments Basa head of marketing Savannah Feeke-Fortune. The programme for Assembly has been co-curated by Feeke-Fortune along with colleagues Boitumelo ‘Tumy’ Motsoatsoe (Basa head of programmes) and Madeleine Lambert (Basa head of research). Says Basa CEO Ashraf Johaardien: “One of the aims is to sketch a clearer picture of what’s happening in the South African arts and culture landscape at this moment in time. There is an urgency attached to the needs of the arts sector and we wanted to reflect this with a solutions-driven programme. The arts need a new stratagem and we all have to play a role in supporting its survival at this critical stage.” Basa Assembly, partnered by the British Council, is open to all, free to attend and will be hosted at https://basa.co.za. The initiative kicks off on 24 March 2021 with a launch package streamed by media partner Social TV, featuring a keynote address by Dali Tembo. Tembo is a leading cultural trends strategist and youth trends expert, who has delivered strategic guidance to numerous multinational corporations across Africa, the UK, the US and MEA. From 25 March 2021, the two-day programme of talks, debates, performances and data sharing is intentionally focused on creating space for new voices via panel discussions, podcasts, interview and thought-leader presentations. Thematically, the aim is to offer insight into navigating the current cultural landscape, particularly with challenges around funding, marketing and visibility outside of the creative sector.
