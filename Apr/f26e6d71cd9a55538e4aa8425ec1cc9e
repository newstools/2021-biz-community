The country is spoilt for choice when it comes to this remarkable talent and these young expressers are the future of the visual medium in our country. Y.Vitriol is a most modern of artists. Among other mediums she has combined the self-portrait and selfie to enhance her vision, one of a disturber of conformity.

But talent, hard work and desire are far from reliable elevators in the subjective world of art, so please go follow them and support their work. Someone who supports and drives art is MJ Turpin, the co-director of Kalashnikovv Gallery in Johannesburg. When he started Kalashnikovv, his goals were to address some of the lack of support for artists that results in them being traded and treated like commodities. He wanted an alternative to the “traditionalist white cube gallery spaces.” Turpin says that the challenges that young artists face is to not be “swayed by the generic and easy cookie cutter ‘sellable’ aesthetics and to create challenging, thought-provoking work.” When asked what we can do to support the arts in our country, Turpin's answer is simple.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2104/606891.png" alt="What is shaping culture?
