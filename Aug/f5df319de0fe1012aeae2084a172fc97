The goal is for brands to garner an association push without having to create the content themselves or task a creator to do so.Via Spark Ads, brands can pinpoint existing organic videos that complement their campaign, reach out to the creators behind the content, and repurpose their clips for paid campaigns. They can convert the user-generated clips into In-Feed or TopView Ads and benefit from boosting already solid performing content, thereby maximising brand reach.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/614542-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Source:" width="120" height="120">Using TikTok For Business for your brandTikTok recently hosted an event that shed some light on how businesses in South Africa can use the platform to boost their brands by introducing TikTok For Business...By Emily Stander 15 Jun 2021“TikTok is made up of creators who are redefining entertainment, starting trends and sharing with the world their take on popular products and services,” Thwaites explained, “And now, thanks to Spark Ads brands can tap into this plethora of creative, diverse content and connect with the creators who help bring these products and services to life.”Spark Ads is meant to be particularly valuable for smaller brands or companies who are less familiar with TikTok as an advertising platform and who may not have large budgets or creative teams needed for original content.“This product speaks very well to our ‘Don’t make ads, make TikToks' credence,” said Thwaites, “because brand content that works best on the platform is content that resembles or adds value to what consumers are already seeing in their feed.”
