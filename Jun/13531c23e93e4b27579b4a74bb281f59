Along with naming 10 global winners based upon the highest scores from judges, The One Club and The 3% Movement also analyse the next level of highest scoring entrants. This is to recognise those in various regions who may have scored just below the winning level and whose work and creative vision the judges feel deserve honorable mention accolades. Eligible participants are those who are stepping into leadership roles; including copywriters, art directors, designers, ACDs, newly-promoted creative and design directors with less than one year in the role and creative teams who are doing game-changing work. Entries highlighting a candidate’s creativity, leadership and unique point of view must be submitted by 16 July 2021. To make Next Creative Leaders as open and accessible as possible, there is no fee to enter. Next Creative Leaders judging and winnersEntrants are judged on four-to-six pieces of creative work, their background and information about how they — and their work — are pushing the industry forward and making a positive contribution in terms of diversity, mentoring and advocacy.  Winners will be selected by a jury of top creatives and diversity advocates, including past Next Creative Leaders winners and announced at the 10th annual The 3% Conference to be held in Atlanta, USA on 2 and 3 November 2021.GLOBAL<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2106/612715-120x120.png?1" alt="Source:" width="120" height="120">AMV BBDO London wins six Best of Disciplines at The One Show 2021The One Club for Creativity announces AMV BBDO London has received high honors in The One Show 2021 with six Best of Discipline wins...3 Jun 2021Each NCL winner receives a one-year complimentary individual membership with The One Club with opportunities to participate in future One Club awards juries and complimentary tickets to a One Club professional development conference ($1,000+ value), panels and mentorship events.

About Next Creative LeadersKevin Swanepoel, CEO of The One Club, said, “The One Club created its own Inclusion & Diversity Department more than a decade ago and has steadily increased programming around gender equity in the workplace. Next Creative Leaders is an important part of our programming because it identifies, elevates and gives voice to those who are making a real difference by opening the door and inspiring the next generation of creatives who follow in their footsteps.” Kat Gordon, founder of the 3% Movement, said, “The abundance of female and non-binary creative talent in our industry is phenomenally inspiring. The simple act of recognition serves as an accelerant for these winners' careers in a way that inspires even more young women to aim high. 3% is so proud to watch this circle of goodness continue to ripple outward.” Branding for Next Creative Leaders 2021 was designed by NCL 2020 winner Elma Karabegovic, with font designer Zacchary Dempsey-Plante.
