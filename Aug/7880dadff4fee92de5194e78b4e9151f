Premiering on 26 August 2021, Temptation Island South Africa is the ultimate relationship test. Based on the Banijay-owned hit reality format, the show follows four couples at a crossroads in their relationship, where they must mutually decide if they are ready to commit to one another for the rest of their lives, or go their separate ways. Together, the couples experience a luxurious holiday in paradise (aka Knysna), where they live separately - with 20 sexy single men and women who are looking for love. This last taste of the single life is meant to help answer their most difficult questions about their relationship, like, “Are we meant to be?” and “Is there someone better out there for me?”Here are the 10 potential upgrades for the four South African women who were brave enough to put their love on trial: Estelle Langa, Musa Qubinkomo, Nthabiseng Maphago and Precious Khumalo. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2108/622808.jpg" alt="First-look: meet the single guys of Temptation Island South Africa" width="550" height="367">Brandon ‘Shabangz’ Tshabangu23 | Cape Town | Zone controller | @mr_congenialityy on InstagramOriginally from Durban but now living in the Mother City, Brandon is all about the “good vibes, good times and good people.” He describes himself in his Instagram bio as the life of the party. ‘Mr Amapiano Moves’ has been single for a year, but he’s ready to get back in the game and intends on using much more than his smile and poetry skills to do that. “My power of seduction?
