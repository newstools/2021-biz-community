Another mobile-based fraud, remote-controlled fraud, is listed in the report as being responsible for 7.6% of all fraudulent mobile activities targeting African cellular users. This is where malware takes control over devices to make fraudulent payments. Three other types of fraud identified in the report accounted for almost 10% of mobile fraud.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2107/617649.jpg" alt="Kaseya ransomware attack: 80% of companies that pay are hit a second time" width="120" height="120">Kaseya ransomware attack: 80% of companies that pay are hit a second timeCybereason CEO and co-founder Lior Div provides insightful commentary on the recent ransomware attack that is affecting companies worldwide...By Lior Div 6 Jul 2021The top three malicious apps in Africa in the first half of this year according to the report are funny SMS, Asters Wallpapers and Magic Photo Editor, each downloaded over more than 10,000 times. These apps have already been removed from the app store thanks to Evina.“Detecting fraud fast depends on implementing proven, highly-responsive technology that’s as agile as its target. There will always be fraud present around digital transactions, however, mobile fraud can be effectively managed with the right tools backed up by solid relationships with the appropriate experts,” says Lotfi.
