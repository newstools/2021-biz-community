Since returning to CapeTalk, he has hosted several shows including an evening talk programme and, most recently, the fast-paced Midday Report. "Lester is warm, professional and always surprising. His unique sense of humour and view on  the world is ideal for late morning radio. He's a storyteller at heart - his show will focus on caller engagement, interesting stories and exciting interviews. His weekly profile interview In the Chair is already proving popular since it debuted on Monday with politician and cleric Allan Boesak," says Tessa van Staden, CapeTalk station manager. The Morning Review with Lester Kiewit happens weekdays 9am to 12pm. The show gets Cape Town talking about the news stories shaping the city, intertwining high-profile interviews with local Cape Town callers. The show is challenging, conversational, thought-provoking and fun, while also having the tough conversations South Africans need to have. "I'm excited for the longer-show duration - now we can really talk; delve into local issues and unpack the characters and stories making headlines. I want people to sit at their desk or in their car until the interview is done - and then share the podcast with friends. My goal is to deliver gripping, must-hear radio," said Kiewit.Listen to The Morning Review with Lester Kiewit, weekdays 9am - 12pm on CapeTalk 567 AM.To find us on social media, follow: Lester Kiewit on Twitter @lesterkk  Twitter: @CapeTalkFacebook: @CapeTalkAbout CapeTalk CapeTalk is a premium multimedia platform that is inspired to empower its audience through honest, truthful and insightful conversations.
