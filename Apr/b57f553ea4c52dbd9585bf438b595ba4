We can’t wait to celebrate and immerse ourselves in Lion-winning creativity alongside our community in June.”Lions juries will take part in remote judging from their home locations worldwide. Speaking about the process, head of the Awards Susie Walker, explains: “Judging is a very human experience. It must also be a rigorous and robust process. Our unique judging platform, successfully trialled at other Lions awards this year, has been built to ensure the value and integrity of the Lion is upheld. We’re committed to delivering a judging experience that allows jurors to do their job without hindrance, and crucially, we want every piece of creative work to be given the time and discussion it deserves.”285 awarding jurors are now named and a further 189 shortlist jurors will be announced shortly…Entries into the Lions are currently being accepted.
