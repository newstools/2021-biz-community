Businesses and organisations are fast acknowledging the benefit of owned, highly leveraged communities to their bottom-line, but the problem is that many don’t know how to connect their fragmented audiences, nor manage them to the benefit of the business.Some of the organisations that typically face this problem include public audio and broadcast businesses, as well as organisations that communicate in a private way with their various customers, partners and stakeholders.  Many of these organisations have closed communities, who often resort to using Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger or similar to engage with their members, or otherwise they use traditional communication channels like newsletters.   This can be frustrating because it doesn’t result in engaged or connected audiences. It can also create delays and closed, one-way communication. On top of this, much of the technology used by such businesses and organisations is outdated, and many have yet to harness digital to their advantage.Take the digital leapDigital tools and technologies should be embraced, not feared, as businesses will benefit from the capabilities offered by exciting, modern, cloud-based technologies, including data-driven insights.  History teaches us that if we are brave and overcome our fear, we are most often rewarded. This is especially so for businesses that understand the key to growth is to build and leverage ‘owned’ digital communities. For those with closed communities, it can result in growing “your own private social network”. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2101/594572.png" alt="Technology can help you grow your business" width="120" height="120">Technology can help you grow your businessAccording to the 2020 National Income Dynamics Study - Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey, three million South Africans lost their jobs as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns last year...27 Jan 2021We developed a cloud-based platform with tools and applications focused on community engagement that aims to alleviate this frustration for businesses and organisations.
