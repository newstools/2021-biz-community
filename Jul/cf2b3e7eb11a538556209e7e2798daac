Bookmark folders This feature enables users to better organise their saved tweets by allowing them to create various folders in the bookmarks tab and sort their tweets into said folders. This will make it easy and efficient for Twitter users to find their save content. Reader mode At the moment, there are third-party websites you can go to unroll Twitter threads. Reader mode addresses this by making it easier for users to keep up with long threads on the platform by turning them into easy-to-read text, so you can read all the latest content seamlessly.
