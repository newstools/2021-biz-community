Students simply need support at home and access to quality online schooling is one way to ensure that, over and above adult supervision and assistance. Key to introducing TelkomOne Ignite was ensuring that it was affordable across the board too. We have also been particular in our selection of the content; providing the right content mix of career-related topics, CAPS lessons and edutainment and I believe we ended up with the right formula,” said Sarah Mthintso, Telkom’s Head of Foundation. Last year the Telkom Foundation partnered with Lightbulb Education during the first national lockdown in an effort to facilitate seamless virtual learning and teaching. Mthintso explained: “We are definitely committed and constantly exploring opportunities to drive education as an organisation. We want to give as many viable options to students as possible."Lightbulb Education is a zero-rated e-learning platform for Telkom users designed to enable remote learning and teaching.
