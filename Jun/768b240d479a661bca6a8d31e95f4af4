This beautifully parallels Nungu Diamonds’ passion for the provenance of each diamond we sell, with Nescafé’s commitment to sustainably sourced coffee beans,” Pule said.Meanwhile, Kholofelo Xesha Masha of Xesha Time Pieces, said the partnership provided the African watchmaker with an opportunity to highlight how the care that goes into every jar of Nescafé Gold to deliver a unique coffee cup experience. “It is never just a watch or another time-piece for us, in the same way that it is never just a cup of coffee, it is for the discerning taste of the person seeking the finer things in life for which Nescafé Gold is known. This collaboration has allowed us to share part of our African story with Nescafé and allow Nescafé to share their inspiring story through our time-pieces,” Masha said.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/2011/585555-120x120.jpg?2" alt="PlatAfrica jewellery design competition winners revealed for 2020" width="120" height="120">PlatAfrica jewellery design competition winners revealed for 2020PlatAfrica aims to promote innovation and technical expertise in platinum jewellery design and manufacturing in South Africa and provide international exposure to jewellers, apprentices and students...17 Nov 2020How to enterEach month from May to August, consumers can win the bespoke Xesha timepiece and/or the specially created Nungu Diamonds jewellery by purchasing any two participating Nescafé Gold products at their nearest retailer. “We are very excited about the partnership with Nungu Diamonds and Xesha watches.
