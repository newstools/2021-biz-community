Work has changed, possibly forever, being in the ‘office’ has a completely new meaning; and managing, communicating with, and operating your team as a leader has required a new view on process. Challenges have always brought opportunities though and 2020 was no different. It took everyone time to find their feet, but wow has presented our industry some great opportunities.Green screen technology brought with it - new worlds, new stage sets, new ways to present content and new ways to connect globally.
