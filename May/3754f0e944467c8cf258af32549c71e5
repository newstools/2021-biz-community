The Men’s and Women’s Rugby Africa Cup, Sevens tournaments, and the U/20 Barthés Trophy are some of the key drivers of the work they do on the continent. Of the 39 member nations, 24 are full or associate members of World Rugby. Head of the finance committee at Rugby Africa, Herman Mensah, said that Rugby Africa has also evolved with the sport over the years. In 2019, Rugby Africa’s competitions were redesigned to improve representation through continental and regional tournaments. Fixture additions included the Men’s and Women’s Rugby Africa Cup, several regional Sevens tournaments, continental Men’s, and Women’s Sevens tournaments and the U/20 tournament. Rugby has grown into a multinational phenomenon, best witnessed in popular culture through the decisive Rugby Africa Cup. On the world stage, we are proud to have taken the cup home as a continent, most specifically through South Africa (the current world champions). To enter, go to: Media Award / Photography Award
