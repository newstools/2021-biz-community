We are strong advocates of the power of purpose-driven business and we’re excited to do meaningful work that has a genuine impact on our clients..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Could we see any new fresh approaches to customer experience?Our approach is purpose-driven, cross-functional, and dedicated to outcomes.We hold purpose at the heart of customer experience because it forms the emotional connection that a more rational sales funnel can then operationalise. Being purpose-driven is also widely acknowledged as leading to better business outcomes.We’re cross-functional because we believe that’s the best way to deliver innovative ideas. So we build bespoke teams based on project requirements rather than relying on the same set of talent to solve very different sorts of challenges.And we’re extremely pragmatic, preferring to focus on workable solutions than blue-sky idealised thinking. Our mantra is ‘be useful or be gone’. If we’re not delivering results, what’s the point?.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What can organisations no longer ignore when it comes to their CX strategy?First, that it’s a business critical area not a nice-to-have. Second, that engaged, inspired staff play a fundamental role in delivering a seamless CX (something purpose can really help to ignite). And third, that if the customer experience is not coherent, connected and concise it’s unlikely to deliver against customer expectations..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How important is it for brands to tell stories that resonate with consumers?To wear a traditional marketing and communication hat for a moment, yes compelling, relevant storytelling drives deeper engagement and more willingness to consider and transact.But it’s important to remember that you are always telling a story. Whether you’re doing it intentionally or not, each interaction the customer has with you leaves an impression, carries a specific tone, and adds to the picture that they’re registering and reinforcing in their minds about what your brand is all about. So even if you aren’t communicating in the traditional sense, it’s important that you know what story you’re trying to land about your brand so that you can design your customer experience to be consistent with what your brand is promising to deliver. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What sort of CX trends can we see in 2021? Technology-driven innovation: specifically focused on service transformation.Experimentation with different avenues for fulfilment: different businesses testing and betting on different approaches to customer delivery.A focus on the blended journey: planning for the dynamic interplay of online and offline rather than viewing them through separate lenses.Greater integration: more examples of e-commerce baskets holding goods across portfolio brands, and greater integration with third party platforms.More ‘primary data’ relationships: businesses building more direct relationships with their customers given the increasing clampdown on the availability of third party data. The rise of the ‘experience intermediary’: third party businesses who can plug into and deliver fulfilment so that businesses are freer to focus on other primary aspects of their operation.
