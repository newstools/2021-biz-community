Gerety Awards brings a nice balance to this by having an all-female panel to judge creative work from a uniquely female lens. This year, the Singapore panel was made up of women creative leaders of different races and cultures which brought about a diversity of thinking to the decision making process. It was nice to see how while we all had our unique takes, favourite pieces and differences of opinions. We all collectively agreed on the best work - goes to show that good creative work transcends individual differences.” Sessions were held around the world with international executive juries of agency and brand leaders. The judging was followed by jury insight panels. The free to watch events were billed as creative awakenings with each panel, including some of this year's judges from the different jury locations in London, Berlin, Budapest, Milan, Singapore, Lagos, Toronto, Santiago, Los Angeles and Paris.UK Agency of the Year: MRM LondonU.S. Agency of the Year: McCann New YorkFrench Production Company of the Year: Quad GroupHungarian Agency of the Year: White Rabbit BudapestNigerian Agency of the Year: Publicis InsightCanadian Agency of the Year: Taxi TorontoCanadian Production Company of the Year: Grayson MusicItalian Agency of the Year: VMLY&R ItalyAgency of the year by country is chosen by the local juries from the portfolio cut and requires a single film no longer than five minutes in length that includes up to three pieces of work from the past 12 months.Most shortlisted campaign: “Not For Lease” for Roncesvalles BIA (Business Improvement Association) by The Local Collective in CanadaMost shortlisted network: across 17 different offices is McCann WorldgroupMost shortlisted country: with 35 entries on the shortlist from 17 different companies is the USAMost shortlisted category: across different media is the Works for Good Cut with a total of 47 entries.Most shortlisted production company: Biscuit Filmworks Los AngelesThe grand jury includes  Odette van der Haar, CEO, The Exponential Company and presenter of Business Beat South Africa and Kate Stanners, chairwoman and global chief creative officer at Saatchi & Saatchi London.
