Consumers are becoming ever more aware of their choices and the expectations and standards they hold brands to.

The research also reveals that 66% of those surveyed said that interviews with an international news partner are the most influential way for consumers to learn about a brand’s CSR, followed by branded content within a premium environment (35%). These are techniques brands can leverage to help deliver their sustainability message to consumers at scale. Lori Suchcicki, senior vice president Commercial Partnerships, BBC Global News, EMEA said, “Sustainability is an ever-increasing priority for consumers in their purchase decision, yet this research indicates there is a gap between a brand’s sustainability practices and consumer awareness. To retain customer loyalty, and attract new consumers, this gap needs to be addressed by developing an authentic and transparent narrative. The BBC’s expert storytellers have a long history in bridging this gap by engaging with global audiences through creative and emotive brand campaigns.”
